<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>In presenting this brief history of La R&eacute;union, we
realize that the story may appear too long for such a
seemingly unimportant event in our state history, but
to those who are doing research work, especially years
hence, the details can not be too numerous. Even now
great difficulties present themselves in tracing down the
materials that are now in existence.</p>
<p>Extensive quotations have been used throughout the
monograph, too extensive in fact, but the production of
these documents in full rather than in part may be justified
on the basis of making them available to students
of Texas History. Additional material has been given
in the appendix where it was deemed too long to include
such materials in the story, and it is thus given as a
mere narrative of facts of one of the great romantic
attempts to settle Texas and the Southwest. We have
avoided complicating the story by not discussing socialism
per se, dealing with its connection with La R&eacute;union
only when necessary for an understanding of the activities
of the colonists.</p>
<p>We wish to express our thanks to the librarians of
the Public Library in Fort Worth, the Texas University
Library, and Congressional Library for the loan of books,
and especially to Mrs. Bertie Mothershead, former
librarian at Texas Christian University for her co-operation
and helpfulness.</p>

<h2 id="c1">INTRODUCTION
<br />SOCIALISM CROSSES THE ATLANTIC</h2>
<p>The last half of the eighteenth century was a period
of awakening for the masses of western Europe; revolution
thundered in Paris and reverberated throughout all
Europe. Thrones tottered and fell; others rose to take
their places. Republics were created by the revolutions
overnight to live and thrive only during the predominance
of the French Revolution, and then fade into the
kingdoms from whence they had emerged. Peoples were
led to believe that the day of Utopia had arrived and
they turned upon their masters and oppressors to destroy
them, and then, in return, were led to the battlefields
and slaughtered for the whimsical desire for glory of the
man who rode the waves of emotional fanaticism to
power. Out of the mad chaos created by such desires
and emotions a new system of economic hope was
created. French dreamers and intellectuals had seen, in
a short time of twenty-five years, the ultimate hopes of a
nation rise to exalted heights in a sort of religious fanaticism
and then plunge to depths of despair. A culture or
civilization in which such a catastrophe as that could
happen, so the philosophers thought, must be faulty beyond
repair. Some of these philosophers surrendered to
discouragement and pessimism while others sought to
rebuild and reconstruct the crumbling ruins of the past.
Claude-Henri Saint Simon, Louis Blanc, Fran&ccedil;ois
Fourier, Pierre Proudhon, Karl Marx, Robert Owen,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Charles Kingsley, Saint Jean-Baptiste La Salle, Frederic
Engels, and Johann Rodbertus were some of the most
prominent socialists and thinkers who attempted to find
a solution to the economic ills of Europe and to guarantee
an equitable distribution of wealth to the masses of
the people.<a class="fn" id="fr_0_1" href="#fn_0_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>This new system became known as socialism and was
a middle class movement which developed out of the
shattered eighteenth century era. Side by side with
socialism developed communism, a doctrine developed
out of the working class needs which, it was thought by
some, neither socialism nor capitalism could satisfy.
Socialism, as maintained by nineteenth century philosophers,
stemmed not only from the old totalitarian doctrine
of the Greek city-state but from the old concept
of a universal pattern of cultural religion and economics
of the medieval period. The philosophers were only
substituting economics for medieval religion in the new
social theory. The spirit of co-operative good, of theoretical
equality and ultimate perfection of society are common
to both Utopian socialism and religion. The socialists
visualized a world of productivity sufficient to abolish
poverty and furnish abundance to those who worked.
The problem, as they understood it, was to prevent the
concentration of enormous wealth in the hands of a few
individuals by which those who possess wealth deprive
the masses of equitable distribution of goods. This concentration
could be prevented, so thought the socialist,
if production and distribution could remain in control
of the people who produced the materials. The socialist
dreamed of an economy in which there would be a social
development along with the economic but in which all
inequality and special privilege would be eliminated from
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
both political and economic life. One writer has defined
socialism as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A socialized industry is one in which the material
instruments of production are owned by a public authority
or voluntary association and operated, not with
a view to profit by sale to other people, but for the
direct service of those whom the authority or association
represents. A socialized system is one the main
part of whose productive resources are engaged in
socialized industries.<a class="fn" id="fr_0_2" href="#fn_0_2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over against the socialist theory was the pragmatic
theory of capitalism already operating in many parts of
Europe and America. The same writer defines capitalism
as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A capitalist industry is one in which the material
instruments of production are owned or hired by
private persons and are operated at their orders with a
view to selling at a profit the goods or services that they
help to produce. A capitalist economy, or capitalist
system, is one the main part of whose productive resources
is engaged in capitalist industries.<a class="fn" id="fr_0_3" href="#fn_0_3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of the socialist movement there developed three
different types: first, socialism as represented by the
Utopian idealism which is apparently impractical but
which doesn&rsquo;t encourage hostility between classes,
groups or individuals; second, Marxian socialism which
theoretically conceives of a classless society and which
recognizes a ceaseless war between the so-called privileged
and the underprivileged; and third, liberal socialism
which involves the gradual socialization of all means
of production and distribution by permitting it to remain
definitely in the hands of the producer and consumer
through governmental agencies or co-operating groups.<a class="fn" id="fr_0_4" href="#fn_0_4">[4]</a>
This latter type of socialism is the kind that many governments
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
of the world are adopting today by the procedure
of the established political parties in those states
acquiring what appears to them as the practical socialist
doctrines as new platforms and policies. These conceptions
of socialism are tenets of early socialism and not
of the many varieties operating under the name at the
present time.</p>
<p>It is Utopian socialism rather than Marxian which
developed into a strong movement in Europe during the
nineteenth century but failed to materialize as a successful
movement. This failure to gain immediate success
was accepted by the leaders of socialism as a weakness
of society instead of lack of merit in socialism, and the
failure was explained as due to the inherent conditions
of a traditionally bound European culture. Therefore,
success, so the leaders thought, required only the transfer
of their efforts to new lands where traditions had not
yet been so thoroughly established. America was one of
these new lands where Utopias could be built in the vast
spaces beyond the frontiers. And so these dreamers
turned their eyes toward the United States as a place
where doctrines could be established and success could
be achieved. However, neither here nor in Europe has
the Utopian dream approached realization.</p>
<p>Robert Owen was one of the Utopian socialists who
crossed the Atlantic to the United States seeking to
escape the inheritance of European culture so that he
could develop his socialism in a new world. Owen was
the son of a saddler, well-educated, religious, and thoroughly
trained in business. He organized New Harmony
in the United States, an undertaking which cost him
three to five years of his life and four-fifths of his fortune.
Another settlement similar to New Harmony, located
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
near Glasgow, Scotland, was attempted by him but also
failed. Perhaps due to his eminent success in business
in the British Isles, Owen was received by American
leaders with more public acclaim than any other socialist.
However, due to rash unorthodox religious statements
and his temporary denouncement of marriage, he soon
became unpopular in the United States as well as in the
British Isles.</p>
<p>Owen was absolutely opposed to violence of any kind
and was extremely favorable to recognition of the value
of capital. He withdrew from the labor movement
after the leaders had violated his doctrine expressed in
his <i>Address to the Workman</i>, namely, that all workers
must renounce hatred and violence directed against the
capitalist or ruling class.<a class="fn" id="fr_0_5" href="#fn_0_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>While Owen failed to establish a Utopia in Europe
or America, he did have great influence as stated by
one writer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet, despite his errors in judgment and the
failure of many of his plans, the great-hearted and
lovable cotton manufacturer and communist did exert a
profound influence on the social thinking of the world.
His indictment of the present order of society for its
waste, its injustices, its tragedy of unemployment; his
emphasis on social happiness as the ideal of human progress;
his insistence that character was profoundly influenced
by social environment; his urgent plea that all
co-operate for the common welfare in the production
and distribution of wealth, all these left their imprint
on future generations. And his life of untiring devotion
and sacrifice proved one of the great sources of inspiration
to those who followed later in the socialist, co-operative,
and trade union movements, as well as those
who worked in behalf of child training, of labor legislation,
of prison reform, and of similar causes.<a class="fn" id="fr_0_6" href="#fn_0_6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Another class of socialists found in the United States
who came from across the Atlantic consisted of various
religious groups. New Harmony itself had been originally
created and founded by the Rappists and later purchased
by Owen.</p>
<p>Fourier was to France what Owen was to England.
There is a great difference between the position of men
like Owen and Fourier and the one assumed by those
who accepted Karl Marx, whose doctrines are best represented
by Wilhelm Weitling. The communism of the
first group was merely the communal possession of goods
produced by communal effort with no thought of class
conflict or the confiscation of goods produced by other
means. This group sought to deny hostility and hatred
between classes saying that the wealthy had the same
desire to create a perfect society as did those who labored
for a living. Marx held to the view that constant conflict
between classes was fundamental.</p>
<p>Frederick Engels in evaluating the Utopian socialist
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To all these Socialism is the expression of absolute
truth, reason, and justice, and has only to be discerned
to conquer all the world by virtue of its own power.<a class="fn" id="fr_0_7" href="#fn_0_7">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marxian socialism, on the other hand, is in direct contrast
to the Utopian. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From this time forward Socialism was no longer an
accidental discovery of this or that ingenious brain, but
the necessary outcome of the struggle between two historically
developed classes&mdash;the proletariat and the
bourgeoisie.<a class="fn" id="fr_0_8" href="#fn_0_8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, it came about that the United States was
fortunate in receiving whatever socialistic contributions
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
it has received from the English and French Utopian
socialism of reason rather than from the ruthless Marxian
socialism of conflict which never has had any great
influence in the United States.<a class="fn" id="fr_0_9" href="#fn_0_9">[9]</a> All the colonies established
by the followers of Fourier and Owen have disappeared.
La R&eacute;union, a French colony in Texas, furnishes
a splendid opportunity to analyze the reasons for
these failures.</p>

<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER I
<br />FOUNDERS OF THE COLONY</h2>
<p>La R&eacute;union, a French settlement in Texas, was the
result of the efforts and teachings of three men: Albert
Brisbane, Charles Fran&ccedil;ois Fourier, and Victor Prosper
Considerant. These men were all middle-class and all
were Utopian socialists. Both Brisbane and Considerant
visited the colony but Fourier&rsquo;s contribution was confined
to the promulgation of the ideas and theories which
formed a basis of the colony.</p>
<p>Owenism in England and Fourierism in France grew
out of the distaste of businessmen for business as it
was conducted during the transition period between
the dominance of the Mercantile System and the
achievement of control of society by the new capitalistic
groups. Both Owen and Fourier deserted what
promised to be a fruitful and very successful business
life in order to project their fantasia of reform. The
origin of these doctrines of Utopian socialism in such an
environment perhaps explains the non-violent principles
insisted upon by both Owen and Fourier.</p>
<p>Fourierism may be better understood when it is realized
that Lyon, the home of Fourier, was the most highly
industrialized city in France at the beginning of the
nineteenth century. There was constant strife between
the owners and guild workers, oftentimes developing
into open warfare. Poverty and fear of insecurity were
general. Thus Fourier was able to observe and to compare
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
capitalism with the co-operative nature of peasant
efforts in the rich agricultural area surrounding the city.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_1" href="#fn_1_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Fourier was born in Besan&ccedil;on, France, in
1772, and while yet a child he mastered Latin and Greek,
as was the custom in the educational system of those
days. His father was a middle-class merchant who was
frugal, if not too honest, and who was able to gather
a small fortune of two hundred thousand francs of which
Fran&ccedil;ois inherited one-half at his father&rsquo;s death. In 1793
he lost his inheritance in an insurrection of the village
against the French Convention then in power in France.
In the same year he was forced into the army by a decree
of the National Assembly, which provided that every
man between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five should
be conscripted for service. In 1797 he quit the army
and returned to Lyon to enter business as a clerk. While
making a living clerking in the store, he amused himself
by writing. He published an article in a magazine in
Lyon in 1803, another article in 1804; finally in 1808
his first important work, <i>Theory of the Four Movements
and the General Destinies</i>, came from the press.</p>
<p>This work was met by indifference and disdain everywhere;
even Fourier&rsquo;s mother tried to persuade him to
discontinue his work and make amends for that already
published. However, he persisted. During the winter
of 1815 and 1816 he left Lyon and retired to Talissier,
where he prepared his second great work, <i>Le trait&eacute; de
L&rsquo;association domestique agricole ou attraction industrielle</i>.
It was after the production of these works that
Just Muiron, one of his most faithful disciples, came to
him. During these years and immediately thereafter,
Fourier thought out and planned an elaborate system of
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
socialism, or economic policy, which the world today has
rejected as a fantastic Utopia incapable of realization.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_2" href="#fn_1_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Fourier&rsquo;s idea was one of mass production and systematic
co-operation which was to be accomplished by
minute organization, the unit of which was to be a
phalange or phalanx. People were to be impelled into
this system, rather than compelled, as is the method of
many Utopian schemes. No force or compulsion was
to be used. The whole process of evolving such a society
was to be so natural and logical that people would accept
the scheme without any persuasion. Happiness and prosperity
would be obtained by a minute co-ordination of
the various duties of the members of the phalanx, and
that without any community of property. The phalanx
would, in order to be successful, contain approximately
two thousand members, all living in the same huge
buildings known as phalansteries, which would contain
the workshops as well as living quarters. This settlement
was to be surrounded with a few leagues of land which
the members worked when desire prompted them to
do so.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_3" href="#fn_1_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Under Fourier&rsquo;s plan, however, work was to be nothing
more than organized sport, and thus by competitive
effort all necessary work was to be pleasantly done.
Each community was to be self-sustaining and each member
was to draw from a common storehouse all the
necessities of life, provided, of course, that he had agreed
to the unity of goods and property. Food and clothing
were not to be held in equal share, but to be distributed
according to the merits of each member of the phalansteries.</p>
<p>Each person was to gain initiative by the emotional
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
passions which mutual attraction naturally developed.
Misery, poverty, and unhappiness, according to Fourier,
came from suppression of natural desires and passions.
All that was required for perfect harmony in social life
was the harmonious development and satisfaction of
natural desires. People were misled only because civilization,
by its unnatural laws of suppression, prevented men
and women from full acquisition and use of their natural
talents. Each person and each phalanx was to be brought
into competition with others in the arts of commerce,
labor, learning, and various activities of life. Then, too,
desire for company, for association and union would be
fulfilled by the bringing together of several hundred men
and women into one phalanx or more. Whenever one
form of labor or association became monotonous for
the individual, he could easily transfer to another
type of work and a new group of associates. Women
were to be relieved of the monotony and drudgery of
housework and the rearing of children. These duties,
which had previously been forced upon the women,
would be abolished by the switching from one type of
labor to another, and by the organizing of children into
special phalanges of their own.</p>
<p>Fourier was neither a clear thinker nor a logical
writer.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_4" href="#fn_1_4">[4]</a> In fact, all his writings are disorderly and his
system has no logical outline nor organization. He was
never able to impart to his disciples an impulse of victory
and desire such as great men are frequently able to do.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_5" href="#fn_1_5">[5]</a>
However, what Fourier lacked, his most prominent follower,
Victor Prosper Considerant, possessed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Considerant was born in Salins, France, in 1808 at
the foot of the Jura mountains, of a family belonging
to the bourgeoisie. His father was a distinguished
humanist, translator of English treatises, librarian for the
city, and headmaster of a small school. The family was
poor and the parents often had boarders in order to make
financial ends meet. Considerant finished school at Salins
and then entered the Lyc&eacute;e de Besan&ccedil;on in order to prepare
himself for L&rsquo;Ecole Polytechnique. While attending
school in Besan&ccedil;on he met Just Muiron in the home
of Mme. Vigoureaux who, with several others, was
giving considerable time to the study of the works of
Fourier. Mme. Vigoureaux had lived in Salins and had
sent her son to Considerant&rsquo;s father for instruction; it
was thus natural for Considerant to spend a portion of
his time in her home. Besides the boy, she had two
daughters, one of whom later became the wife of Considerant
and accompanied him to Texas.</p>
<p>In 1826, at the age of eighteen, Considerant entered
L&rsquo;Ecole Polytechnique and was in due time graduated,
whereupon he immediately entered the army and soon
attained the rank of captain. After a short service with
the army, he felt that he should give all of his time to
the spreading of the teachings of Fourier and, finally,
after some hesitation, resigned his commission in the
army. Marshall Soult, to whom he applied for release,
told him that his resignation would not be accepted for
the army needed officers of his type, but that he would
be granted indefinite leave of absence, and that he might
return to the army at any time with the same rank
as he then held.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_6" href="#fn_1_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Considerant also attended school in Metz and from
there he went to Paris, where he set about his work.
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
In June, 1832, the first number of the <i>Phalanst&eacute;re</i>, organ
of the Fourierists, appeared. The principal contributors
to the paper were Considerant, Baudet-Dulary, Jules
Lechevalier, Just Muiron, Am&eacute;dee Paget, Pellarin, Renaud,
Clarisse Vigoureaux, and Fourier. The followers
of Fourier rejected the name Fourierists and accepted as
an official title <i>phalanst&eacute;riens</i> and the constituent parts
were to be known as <i>phalanst&eacute;re</i> or phalange. The paper
soon brought discord, or rather the discord was inherent
in the publication. Fourier thought that the whole
movement should be advertised or established by an
actual experiment, while the disciples thought that conferences,
pamphlets, political actions, public speeches,
and other means should be used to get the plan before
the people. Then, too, besides Fourier, others led a
mild revolt from the group which Considerant apparently
controlled.</p>
<p>Fourier had an opportunity to see his scheme tested
and his idea of propagation carried out when in 1833
Baudet-Dulary, deputy from the Seine-et-Oise, purchased
five hundred hectares of land near the forest of
Rambouillet and founded a society with a capital of
1,200,000 francs for the purpose of trying out the
phalange idea. The subscription did not reach five
hundred thousand francs and failure came quickly. The
members could not agree, a sad situation which was
repeated later at La R&eacute;union, and the company broke
up greatly in debt. The disappointment was great to
Fourier; &ldquo;he grew old quickly, his health declined, a
bitter disquietude seized him,&rdquo; and he died at the home
of Mme. Vigoureaux, October, 1837. His death freed
Considerant from certain restraint which the master had
held over him, and permitted Considerant to develop
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
the phalange idea along the line which he thought best
to follow.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_7" href="#fn_1_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Great activity of the school now became imperative.
The Phalanst&eacute;re was succeeded in 1835 by the <i>R&eacute;forme
Industrielle</i>, and in the following year the Phalange
made its appearance. On July 30, 1843, the journal
announced further changes, and on August 1, there appeared
the first number of the <i>D&eacute;mocratie Pacifique,
journal des int&eacute;rets des gouvernements et des peuples</i>.
At first the paper appeared three times weekly, later
becoming a daily. This advance and transformation of
the journal was made possible by a gift of four hundred
thousand francs to the society by Arthur Young,
an Englishman. Young, who travelled much in France,
had been converted to Fourierism and made this contribution
to advancement of the doctrine. The <i>D&eacute;mocratie
Pacifique</i>, in a sense, continued the great work
of the St. Simonians, although the Fourierists abstained
from all theorizing on the subject of religion or on minor
changes in social institutions. The great objective was
the organization of the collective life of man strictly
on a scientific basis. In 1840 the school founded a
society for the propagation of the theories held by
Fourier; the capital amounted to seven hundred thousand
francs. With the aid of this money, Considerant
gathered all the manuscripts which Fourier had left and,
combining them into one complete series, published and
sold them. Various other materials were sent out over
Germany, Switzerland, Brazil, Belgium, and the United
States, so that in 1847 in all these countries and in
thirty-four cities in France, great banquets were held in
celebration of the memory of Fourier.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_8" href="#fn_1_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>This was undoubtedly the high tide of Fourierism; in
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
France, and everywhere the propaganda had been
spread, people received and held on to it like fanatics.
Fourier&rsquo;s works went through several editions, his bust
was sculptured and sold throughout the world; Considerant&rsquo;s
writings were in demand everywhere. Even
the government of France feared the <i>D&eacute;mocratie Pacifique</i>
and sought to stem the tide of its influence.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_9" href="#fn_1_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>At the time of the publication of the first issue of
the <i>D&eacute;mocratie Pacifique</i>, the disciples of Fourier,
thanks to the incessant propaganda of Considerant and
his friends, already had a large number of converts, not
only in Paris and other cities in France but in other
parts of the world.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_10" href="#fn_1_10">[10]</a> The paper, being most of the time
published in secret, was housed in various places, having
to be moved frequently with only a moment&rsquo;s notice.
However, the audacity and earnestness of Considerant
and his group of young intellectuals kept it alive. Their
enthusiasm is well illustrated by an incident told by
Brisbane:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those were happy days&mdash;days of faith and enthusiasm,
when material obstacles were but straws to be
blown to the winds before the vehemence of youth under
the inspiration of a grand idea! I remember Considerant
rushing into the office one day&mdash;a red fez cap,
which I had given him to wear to a masked ball a few
days before, on his head,&mdash;and throwing down upon the
sofa a bag of money; &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;is enough
to go on with sometime yet! In twenty years we shall
be in Constantinople.&rdquo; Fourier&rsquo;s idea was that Constantinople
would ultimately become the capital of the
globe.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_11" href="#fn_1_11">[11]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, such inspiration and hope could not
continue under a despotic government such as ruled
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
France. In 1848, a revolution having dethroned Louis
Philippe and established, for the time being, a socialistic
republic, Considerant was elected to the National Assembly.
Three years later, after Napoleon had been
elected president, Considerant, on account of his energetic
protest against the French armies&rsquo; destruction of
the Roman republic and because of his known connection
with the <i>D&eacute;mocratie Pacifique</i>, was condemned
to be transported to some French island, but he was successful
in escaping in disguise to Belgium where he continued
to dwell until he came to the United States.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_12" href="#fn_1_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>The incident of the escape is vividly told by Brisbane,
who says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A great many caricatures of Napoleon had been
posted up in the editorial rooms of the <i>Democratie
Pacifique</i> and these were speedily torn down: I could
see that the editors felt that the reign of despotism
had come; no one could tell how long he himself
would be safe, and every preparation was made to
meet an attack on the office. Fourier&rsquo;s manuscripts
and other valuables were removed to a place of safety
just in time. The attack came, and Considerant made
his escape by disguising himself as a fisherman. Having
shaved his long peculiarly-shaped mustache he was
unrecognizable, even by his intimate friends, and he
thus spent several days fishing under the bridges of
the Seine. At length passports were obtained and he
made his way to Belgium.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_13" href="#fn_1_13">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considerant&rsquo;s relation to the whole Fourieristic movement
is splendidly summed up in an article in the
<i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i>, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The overthrow of the St. Simonian School at Paris
was the point, as is well known, from which the prevalence
of Fourierism commenced. With the failure of its
external success, the whole of the St. Simonian School
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
came to an end, both what was true in it and what was
false. The person, who was the first, and that after a
period of nearly twenty years, to take a lively interest
in the ideas of Charles Fourier, was Just Muiron, who
in the year 1814 attempted to apply them to the &ldquo;Communal
Comptoir.&rdquo; He was sincere and devoted, but did
not possess the qualities to promulgate and defend the
new system of society. It could not succeed, unless a
man was found, combining profound convictions with
ardent zeal, and the gift of eloquence, demanded by
new ideas in order to secure the attention of the public
to the question proposed. Such a man was Victor Considerant.
His education in Polytechnic school had accustomed
him not merely to follow a rigid calculation
but to appropriate its results as actual truths; the
demonstration in figures for Fourier&rsquo;s statements of the
subversion of the present social institutions as regards
the total production was not to be set aside.</p>
<p>It was then but a single step to the idea of an Agricultural
Association leading to the practical side of
Fourier&rsquo;s theory. Considerant was convinced: he formed
personal relations with Fourier himself; ideas were
exchanged; and the chief points of the school, then in
its infancy, were established. After Jules Lechevalier
(now in exile in London) and Abel Transon were
brought into the School, the former lecturing upon its
principles in Paris and the other promulgating them
by his pen, Considerant repaired to Metz, where he
delivered a course on the theory of Fourier, and subsequently
became one of the most active contributors
to the <i>Phalanst&egrave;re</i> or <i>R&eacute;forme Industrielle</i>, which appeared
at the beginning of 1832.</p>
<p>After the failure of a practical experiment at the
time of which Reybaud said &ldquo;There was silence concerning
Charles Fourier,&rdquo; the chief of the later Associative
School, took his stand with fresh energy at the
head of affairs, collected the scattered remains, and
opened a new epoch for the doctrine. Victor Considerant
returned to Paris. Young, bold, a fervent and
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
impulsive speaker, he could not persuade himself that
the cause which he had embraced and professed as the
faith of his whole life was doomed to go down so soon,
and with so little effect. He went to work and wrote
the book, from which the revival of the Social School is
dated, the <i>Destin&eacute;e Sociale, Exposition Elementaire
Complete de la Th&eacute;orie Societaire</i>. In this, he first of
all takes hold of the present condition of Society, showing
that the perversion of its institutions was the cause
of all misery, and that there was no hope of solving the
present problem but in a total transformation of Society.
This work contains Fourier&rsquo;s theory in a comprehensive
shape, but surrounded and in fact penetrated
by an acute and powerful criticism of the whole social
industrial and political condition of France. Considerant
thus started the Social School anew, and from him dates
the progressive importance of Fourierism.</p>
<p>On the 11th of Dec., 1835, he delivered before the
&ldquo;Congress Historique&rdquo; his celebrated lecture on the
&ldquo;True position of Fourierism in respect to the Religious
and Philosophical Convictions of the Time&rdquo;
which he afterwards sent forth from the press, and
which, at that time, caused so much sensation. The
<i>Gazette de France</i> and the <i>Univers</i> attacked it with
extreme violence. The discussion was pervaded by the
spirit of progress, without being absolutely tied down to
the dogmas of Fourier&rsquo;s School. This direction has
(been) always maintained by Considerant, and it is this
which (has) gained an always increasing number of
adherents from among the best youthful intellects to the
higher and more abstract portions of social science.
Entering upon this field, it contains a germ, which,
though still at a distance from its true development, is
alone able to secure its future.</p>
<p>Not less important is the second side, which the
Social School presents in relation to the times. By the
Revolution of July, not merely the political conditions,
but also the political consciousness of the French people
was thrown into confusion on all sides. Each man followed
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
only himself, claiming the liberty to enforce his
convictions by every variety of method. Thus arose
the secret unions of Republicans and Communists,
amidst the public relations of the ever-changing struggle
of parties, which were soon turned into factions, vying
with each other for possession of power. Nowhere was
peace, nowhere security&mdash;the most important interests
neglected for questions of party&mdash;The welfare of the
country was notoriously turned into a game. Disturbances
arose at several points, as at Paris, Lyons, Muhlhausen.
Then the public sentiment gradually began to
react against these merely political movements and to
become weary of them. People no longer wanted Revolution,
and addressed themselves to other problems. The
idea of material welfare emerged from the back ground,
presenting its claims in opposition to political movements.
But those who took up this direction were in
want of an organ, possessing an independent life, and a
representative of material necessities among the new
parties demanding a Republic, Legitimacy, a Constitution
and the Press. For such a position no one was
better fitted than the Social School which has always
acknowledged the principle that the improvement of the
social condition was the true problem of the time without
also perceiving the impossibility of such an improvement
except in a free political State. Here also
Considerant became a leading spokesman, taking his
stand for the first time in decided opposition both to the
Liberals and Conservatives, who displayed no other desire
than to see an exclusive form of Government with a
place in it for themselves. Considerant had found the
points, which were sought by the general demand for
criticism and system, and took possession of them in
the name of Fourier. But we must here do justice to
the elastic spirit of the school, which is by no means
inclined to entrench itself under the dogmas of a master&mdash;it
acknowledges the possibility of progress, the necessity
of measuring with its principles the events of the
day, and fairly uniting all in every field. Considerant
was the first who gave this political direction to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
Social School, which enabled it on a sudden to take such
a strong stand at the side of the social parties in 1848,
not merely as a theoretical school but as a political
power.</p>
<p>The career of Considerant from that time is too well
known to those who have watched the social movements
of the last three or four years, to need any comment in
this place. It is sufficient to have maintained his early
influence in respect to the social movements of the last
ten years. His observations in the United States will
still more forcibly show him the importance of combining
political action with social aspirations, since the
conviction will be forced upon him that there is no
well-founded hope of a possible realization except in
a democratic State.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_14" href="#fn_1_14">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Albert Brisbane of New York was the third man
who took a great deal of interest in the establishment
of La R&eacute;union. He was Considerant&rsquo;s chief lieutenant
in America, and was also a disciple of Fourier. Brisbane
had studied the works of Hegel, St. Simon, and
other great social leaders while in Germany and finally,
by mere chance, came upon the writings of Fourier. He
soon returned to Paris where he placed himself under
the direct teachings of the master, to whom he paid
five francs per lesson for personal instruction.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_15" href="#fn_1_15">[15]</a> Here,
at the same time, he also became acquainted with Considerant
and was closely associated with him and his
group. The part of the doctrine which appealed to
Brisbane is explained in his own words as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First his idea of attractive industry, bearing directly
on the material interest of men. The idea that the productive
labors of mankind&mdash;those of agriculture, mining,
manufacturing, etc.&mdash;now so repulsive, so monotonous,
so wearing to mind and body, and so degrading to
those engaged in them, can be dignified and rendered
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
attractive certainly appears on the surface one of the
most chimerical. Still, Fourier did not undertake to do
this by any abstract, imaginative means, by persuasion
or appeals to moral duties; his process is an entirely new
and practical organization of those labors. It is by a
minute division of their details; by convenient and
labor-saving machinery; by healthy, even elegant workshops,
where a certain refinement could be introduced,
and scientific thought combined with the pursuit of
industry; by short sessions of labor, and the prosecutions
of all of its branches by groups of persons united
in taste and in sympathy of character, thus bringing the
play of the sentiments into industry, and identifying
the social and productive life of man; lastly, by a clear
appreciation on the part of humanity of the importance
of these labors as regards their influence on the cultivation
of the globe, and through that cultivation, on the
whole economy of the planet, its climates, etc.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_16" href="#fn_1_16">[16]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After his return from Europe in 1839, Brisbane began
propaganda for Fourierism, and by the latter part of
that year had won several adherents, the most important
of whom was Horace Greeley. Brisbane and Greeley
started a paper in New York, called the <i>Future</i>, which
lasted only a few weeks. When the paper suspended
publication, Brisbane began a column in Greeley&rsquo;s newly
organized <i>Tribune</i>. Brisbane soon withdrew from this
assignment and went to the <i>Chronicle</i> which he began
to edit, and at the same time, wrote articles for other
publications.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_17" href="#fn_1_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The propaganda had great success; the repercussion,
however, fell heavily upon Brisbane. Various
interests, especially those who saw in socialism an enemy
to established customs, began to attack him severely. In
his memoirs, Brisbane writes concerning the public attitude
toward him at this time as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Gradually, I came to be considered as an atheist, and
advocate of theories subversive of all morality; as a
fomentor of war between classes, and what not. No
color was too black in which to paint my character. For
a while I endeavored to defend myself, but the attacks
were so varied, the blows came from so many quarters
at once, that I soon felt the impossibility of meeting
them and gave it up. Bowing to the necessity of things,
I accepted the reputation thus made for me.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_18" href="#fn_1_18">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only was he attacked editorially, but on some occasions
he would have suffered bodily harm if he had
not escaped.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_19" href="#fn_1_19">[19]</a> Socialism was too new and the principles
were too little known for an adherent to have an unbiased
hearing in a country seething with nationalism,
and in a country where political demagogues would not
hesitate to appeal to any prejudice that they might discover
in an ignorant people.</p>
<p>Brisbane was a remarkable man who really felt the
necessity of revamping the institutions of the world. He
was interested in the most minute details of social and
economic life; for instance, he writes, &ldquo;Women ...
are absorbed in a monotonous repetition of the trivial
degrading occupations of the kitchen and the needle;&mdash;degrading
because they have to be so continually repeated
and on so small a scale.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_20" href="#fn_1_20">[20]</a> Moreover, he thought
the labor of children under the present system was entirely
wasted because of the petty amount of their task.
To overcome such &ldquo;smallness&rdquo; of chores, he advocated
that separate households be abolished and associations
of households be created instead. Thus, woman would
have time to help produce the material necessities of
life and be an equal to man. Such an idea of combinations,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
Brisbane thought, could be applied to all industries
and especially to that of agriculture. There are only
two methods to be followed he believed: the incoherent
or the combined. In his book, <i>Social Destiny of Man</i>,
or <i>Associations and Reorganization of Industry</i>, with
the impulse of a fanatic and the learning of a philosopher,
he weighs the merits of one against the merits
of the other, always with prejudice in favor of the
&ldquo;combined.&rdquo; With provocative thought and earnest application
he creates a favorable impression for &ldquo;associations&rdquo;
or &ldquo;combines.&rdquo; Speaking of agricultural
associations, he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is above all in precautions against fire and other
accidental waste, that the profits (of the Association)
become colossal. All measures of public security are
impracticable with three hundred families, some being
too poor to take necessary precautions, others too careless
or indifferent. We frequently hear of a whole town
being consumed by the imprudence of a single family.
Precautions against insects, rats, etc. become illusive
also, because there is no joint action between these
families. If by great care one farmer destroys the rats
in his granaries he is soon assailed by those of the neighboring
farms and fields, that have not been cleared of
them, for the want of a system of general co-operation,
impossible with the present diversity of interest.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_21" href="#fn_1_21">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, reasons the writer, not only in the matter
of fire protection, but in every other form of agricultural
work, the advantages of the Fourieristic principle of
association are evident, and within the near future all
activities must be carried on in such combination of
various groups.</p>
<p>Brisbane soon became the center of a brilliant group
which believed and taught Fourierism. Some of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
others were: John Allen, the Channings, George W.
Curtis, Charles A. Dana, John S. Dwight, Parke Goodwin,
George C. Foster, Henry James, Horace Greeley,
James Russell Lowell, C. Neidhardt, Francis G. Shaw,
John G. Whittier, George Ripley and many others.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_22" href="#fn_1_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Hundreds became interested and phalanges were established
in many sections of the United States. In fact,
the propaganda was so successful that an avalanche of
applications fell upon Brisbane before he had worked
out any plan of promotion or forms. He warned those
who contemplated forming the &ldquo;associations&rdquo; not to
be hasty and not to make any attempt to put the principles
into operation until they had sufficient capital
to guarantee some sort of success. However, very little
attention was given to his advice and many phalanges
were established, but few were successful.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_23" href="#fn_1_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>It was from the results of the teachings of these three
men, Fourier, Considerant, and Brisbane, and from the
direct effort of the last two that La R&eacute;union was established
in Texas, on the banks of the Trinity river.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;The best elements of the old world ask only to leave
it; let America afford to them a little aid; nothing more
is required, for them at once to join forces with her.
Europe is now driving from her bosom whatever is good;
let America give it a home with herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Considerant, <i>European Colonization in Texas</i>,
p. 29.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER II
<br />AU TEXAS</h2>
<p>Considerant, as a leader of the Fourieristic socialists,
had always refused to combine the teaching or propagandizing
of the movement with any attempt to put the
phalansterian organization of society into operation. He
thought that the proper promotion of either problem
would require too large an outlay of energy and money
ever to combine the two into one undertaking, and
consequently the teaching of Fourierism and the colonization
which would naturally grow out of it should be
separate undertakings. However, Considerant&rsquo;s ideas
changed after his first visit to the United States in 1852;
that is, he was willing to merge the two in a very limited
manner.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_1" href="#fn_2_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Considerant&rsquo;s departure to the United States on his
first visit seemed to have been hurriedly made, for he
said that he left so quickly that he did not have time
to write to any one concerning his proposed trip. At
first, the trip was planned as only a four months&rsquo; tour
of the United States, but it later developed into a search
for a location suitable for the establishment of a colony.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_2" href="#fn_2_2">[2]</a>
On November 28, 1852, he left France and sailed to
Liverpool, from whence he sailed for New York on
December 1, and reached that port about two weeks
later. No one met him at the port and, as Brisbane was
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
in Detroit, he spent the time visiting some phalanges
near New York. Among these were Lowell&rsquo;s and
Lawrence&rsquo;s colonies near Boston, and the North American
Phalanx in New Jersey. The latter was the most
successful and enduring of all the phalanges established
in North America. Considerant, after a six weeks&rsquo; visit,
pronounced the colony a failure in one sense of the
word: the co-operative efforts in economic and social
life were carried out very successfully, but serial development
of other phalanges had been totally abandoned
by the colony. This he regretted very much.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_3" href="#fn_2_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>When Brisbane returned to New York from Detroit,
he immediately got in touch with Considerant, and they
began to discuss what was best to advance Fourierism
in the United States. Brisbane apparently proposed the
founding of a big paper that would literally cover the
United States with propaganda. Considerant, however,
urged that the day of education had passed and proposed
immediate founding of a colony that would show
what actually could be done with Fourierism at work.
The idea of disseminating propaganda should be secondary
to the project itself. Agreed on this part of the program,
the two men began to seek a location for the
proposed colony. Brisbane proposed that lands in Ohio
or Illinois be chosen, but the project was subsequently
rejected both by him and by Considerant along
with many other places. Finally, the following was
urged: first, that the northern, eastern, and western
states should be excluded because of the length and
severity of the winters, the short seasons and the excessive
heat in summer, and by the high price of land in
the Ohio Valley; second, the citizens of the proposed
colony should be of both American and European stock,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
out of which Considerant expected the development of
a super-race; and third, the colony must be located in
the United States and east of the Rocky Mountains.
They thought of going to Santa Fe, but on the advice
of Captain Macy abandoned this plan because it was
too far from the Gulf of Mexico through which the
colonists would have to ship their goods and produce.
Thus, the only possible solution was to locate the
colony somewhere in the South or in Texas. The latter
place was finally agreed upon, and a trip was immediately
planned for investigation of the territory and the
location of the colony.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_4" href="#fn_2_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Considerant and Brisbane left Lake Erie April 30,
1853, where ice was still floating in the lake and the trees
had not yet budded, for Texas. The first day they went
to Cleveland, from there to Wellsville, to Canton, and
then to Cincinnati. Here their arrival was announced
in the papers in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Albert Brisbane and Victor Considerant, two of the
most eminent living Socialists, of the Fourier school,
were in Cincinnati on the 5 inst. Both of these Gentlemen
are able, popular advocates of the Phalansterian
system of the great French associationists above named.
They are on their way to Northern Texas and the Red
River country, for the purpose of selecting from twelve
to fifteen thousand acres of good land, with a view to
the importation of a colony of French and American
Socialists.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_5" href="#fn_2_5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was here, also, that they met several of their old
friends. Considerant refers to &ldquo;our good and old friend
Gingembre,&rdquo; who was living in a small house surrounded
with large trees, which had been built in eight
days by Gingembre and his two sons. The house was
dubbed &ldquo;Gingembree&mdash;Box.&rdquo; John Allen, another leading
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
socialist, met them and promised to sell everything
within eight days after he had received notification of
the location of the new colony and with his sons join
them immediately.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_6" href="#fn_2_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>From Cincinnati their journey led them to Patriot,
where they bade farewell to the last friends they were
to meet, as they thought, until they returned to New
York. Carrying with them only saddles and the barest
necessities of a horseback journey to Texas, they embarked
on a steamship for Fort Smith. They sailed
down the Mississippi river to the mouth of the
Arkansas and up the Arkansas to Little Rock, and
later continued to Fort Smith, where they purchased
horses. Considerant was amazed at the vast spaces of
the West. Again and again he breaks his narrative
to tell of the seemingly impossible stretches of forest,
stream, and mountains. At the frontier, he is charmed
by the contrast between society of the fort and that of
the surrounding country. He says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three social periods could not have been traversed
more quickly. At two o&rsquo;clock that afternoon we were
still in the pleasant town which lies beneath Fort Smith....
Less than two hours afterwards, our horses were
floundering along in the mire, among dead branches
and rotten trunks, through which we traced with great
trouble a kind of a road in the primitive forest, whose
dense vaults anticipated night upon the swampy bottom
lands. It was utterly wild, a deep silent virgin solitude,
exhaling rank perfumes, the compact and luxuriant
vegetation of arborescent masses, and gigantic vines embracing
the large trees in one inextricable network,
vegetable generations rising without the interruptions of
time and space upon the secular ruins of their dying
and dead predecessors.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_7" href="#fn_2_7">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>At the Choctaw Agency he had supper, consisting
of &ldquo;A piece of fish perfectly burnt on one side, but, in
compensation uncooked on the other,&rdquo; onions, and corn.
Considerant reported that a negro slave was the instructor
of the Indians in the Choctaw country, teaching
them the crude elements of agriculture, how to play on
the fiddle, and minor industries. Here at the agency he
apparently became exhausted by the long rides and was
somewhat discouraged over the whole proposition, but
Brisbane soon overcame his discouragement and they
went on.</p>
<p>Eight days out of Fort Smith the two travellers came
to Preston, located on the bluffs of the Red River. On
approaching the town, Considerant describes the surrounding
country and his personal reactions in the following
manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The landscape was classic and charming; its character
surprised us beyond all expression. In all civilized
and cultivated America, I have seen nothing so
sweet, so bewitching, so ornate and complete as these
solitudes by which we entered the high basin of the
Red River. Brisbane and I were struck with the same
idea; we seemed to behold, transported into this rich
climate and under the splendid firmament of latitude
34, those admirable parks, created and sustained at so
great an expense by the high aristocracy of England....</p>
<p>Nature has done all. All is prepared, all is arranged:
we have only to raise those buildings which the eye is
astonished at not finding; and nothing is appropriated
nor separated by the selfish exclusiveness of civilized
man; nothing is cramped. What fields of action! What
a theatre of manoeuvres for a great colonization operating
in the combined and collective mode! What reserves
for the cradle of Harmony, and how powerful
and prompt would be its developments, if the living and
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
the willing elements of the World of the Future were
transported there! A horizon of new ideas, new sentiments
and hopes, suddenly opened before me, and I
felt baptized in an American faith.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_8" href="#fn_2_8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considerant does not describe the town of Preston
and his reaction to frontier life as exhibited there. The
town was full of rough and crude fellows, hijackers,
murderers, and adventurers of all types. An army officer,
passing through the country about the time the
above named travelers were there, reported that the
town was one of &ldquo;bad repute.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_9" href="#fn_2_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>From other sources it is learned that Considerant and
Brisbane remained in the vicinity of Preston for a few
days and then went on toward Clarksville. A letter from
Bourland and Manion, a commercial company out from
Preston, to a Major de Morse says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>Messrs. Albert Brisbane of New York, and Victor
Considerant of France, got to our house a few days ago,
coming into Texas at Preston, and thence to our bend.
They are on their way through northern Texas for the
purpose of selecting some several thousand acres of
land, with a view to the settlement of a French Colony.
They are well pleased with what they have seen. They
remained with us a day and night, and we sent a guide
with them on their way to Gainesville. They are fine
looking, intelligent gentlemen. Their purpose, when
they left our house, was, to examine the Cross Timbers
country, and on to Fort Worth.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_10" href="#fn_2_10">[10]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having reached Texas, Considerant immediately began
to write his reactions. &ldquo;I was expecting something
wild and rude, coarse grasses and weeds of enormous
height, etc.&rdquo; However, he was astonished when he found
a &ldquo;superior richness&rdquo; of the soil, wild oats, numerous
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
tender grasses, large forests, and many prosperous, cultivated
fields. Even the land which the Americans rejected
as poor, rocky, and of thin soil, which they
refused to cultivate, was exactly what the French needed
to grow their vines. Grapevines grown on such soil
were of &ldquo;lower growth and much less run to wood and
leaf, than the kind which overspreads the bottoms. The
latter reaches forth on all sides its gigantic branches
and climbs to the summit of the largest trees, balancing
between them its clusters of black grapes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_11" href="#fn_2_11">[11]</a> Near Dallas,
at the junction of the forks of the Trinity river,
Considerant and Brisbane met M. Gouhenans, chief of
the first Icarian vanguard, who gathered these wild
grapes and made wine out of them, which he sold for
a dollar a bottle.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_12" href="#fn_2_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>The people classified the soil into four kinds: black
sandy, red sandy, mulatto, and black sticky. Considerant
explains that the latter is difficult to work and is
more appropriate for cotton than for anything else.</p>
<p>The reports he gave concerning the crops were very
enthusiastic. For instance, he mentions that he saw
beets grown in unfertilized land that measured two feet
six inches in circumference, and tomatoes that put forth
shoots from ten to twelve feet in length.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_13" href="#fn_2_13">[13]</a> At Fort
Worth and Fort Graham gardens which the soldiers had
prepared were very prolific. Within a few months after
they were planted, there were beans of all kinds, green
peas, melons, sweet potatoes, and twenty other plants of
the kitchen garden, which were succeeding perfectly.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_14" href="#fn_2_14">[14]</a>
All of this was accomplished without manuring the
land, an absolute necessity in Europe. There was no
weeding necessary and only one or two plowings were
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
required. The garden in Fort Worth, so he reported,
had been planted and no further attention given to it,
yet it was in very neat order.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_15" href="#fn_2_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>From the very first day of their trip, when they left
Lake Erie, both men had feared the Texas climate. They
were afraid of the sub-tropic summers, the fevers, langour,
and sun-stroke; consequently, they were surprised
at the favorable reports they received wherever they
went. In Fort Worth, Major Merrill, who commanded
the fort, told them that the winters in Texas were so
little feared &ldquo;that he was in the habit of making excursions
of 15 days, sometime of a month, into the prairie
or forest, without serious inconvenience, and that he
and his men did not often even give themselves the
trouble of erecting tents for the night.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_16" href="#fn_2_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>On inquiry they found that the soldiers of Fort Worth
were comprised of English, French, Irish, Spaniards,
Russians, Swedes; in fact, a very large portion of all
the soldiers was European. However, there was no
complaint of climate&mdash;&ldquo;one perfect accord, not a complaint,
not a regret.&rdquo; The soldiers were happy and well,
in spite of the not very hygienic life and the sudden long
and dangerous expeditions made into the prairies and
forests after the Indians. The settlers, exposed as they
were in cabins open to the wind and rain, were in good
health, and no serious illness was observed, except a few
cases of fever in the district along the coast. Nevertheless,
this is not surprising when one realizes that there
are never more than thirty days of really cold weather
in the winter and that the hot summer days not
tempered with the Gulf breeze are few. Reflections
of the climatic conditions were noticeable in the habits
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
of the live stock. There was an utter lack of shelter
for the stock. Horses, cows, sheep, and goats all wandered
in the woods or on the prairies the entire year
without forage or shelter being furnished them. The
fowls around the houses had to be fed to keep them from
going &ldquo;wild,&rdquo; and effort had to be made to raise them,
but not so with the livestock.</p>
<p>Considerant&rsquo;s estimate of the settlers is worth considering.
When a new settler came, he reported, his
nearest neighbors, living anywhere from six to fifteen
miles from him, asked him on what day he desired to
raise his building, and at that time they all came to aid
him in constructing his modest home. In the meantime,
the family camped in the open in their covered wagon,
the means of transportation used to get to Texas. At
first the settlers intended for the log cabin to be only a
temporary home, but the climate was so mild that they
soon forgot to build more commodious or permanent
buildings until a growing town forced them to do so.
Examples of these settlers becoming financially independent
in a very short time are given by Considerant;
for example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One had come with his wagon, his family, two horses
and four or five dollars; another had only a pair of oxen,
a third nothing at all, and the greater part of the immigrants
were in this plight. We saw it everywhere, and
yet everywhere at the end of some years, these families,
so lately destitute, were surrounded with oxen, with
cows, with horses, with hogs and fowls of their own,
amid their fields which ripened abundant crops of corn,
wheat, Irish and sweet potatoes, etc., and gardens
where ever they chose to make them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>We saw a man who had thus come without any
means, working with a settler, to earn the team of
oxen and the seed with which, three months later, he
was going to commence his farming; we saw the father
of a family already aged, who having begun five years
ago with one cow, had hitherto provided for twelve
children, the eldest of whom was hardly sixteen, and for
two women, without other help than his brother-in-law.
Beautiful cattle, horses and fields in full culture were
the conquests of these five years.</p>
<p>A young French wagon maker arrived two years
since on the upper Trinity with a dollar in his pocket
for all his worldly wealth; he is now proprietor of the
finest workshop in Dallas, which he has built at his own
cost, and has an industrial capital of $1200....<a class="fn" id="fr_2_17" href="#fn_2_17">[17]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He characterizes the settlers as ignorant, destitute,
without capital, without instruments of labor, and without
reciprocal ties. The social conditions cannot be
matched anywhere else in the world; in fact,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its elements, its action and effects, it is doubtless
superior to the Savage state, since it is a seed of civilization
that germinates very fast. But in its form, it is
inferior, for the Indians at least unite in hordes, in
camps or in tribes, while among the settlers, the principle
of separation is pushed to the extreme degree.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_18" href="#fn_2_18">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Fort Graham Considerant and Brisbane returned
by the way of the Colorado River to Austin,
perhaps to San Antonio and thence to New Orleans,
and Havana, reaching New York August 5. Considerant
immediately sailed for Europe, reaching Ostend,
Belgium, August 29, 1853, having had in all a nine-months&rsquo;
trip of exploration and investigation.</p>
<p>With great faith in his glowing reports of Texas,
and with a firm belief that he could offer to the colonists
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
the fullest economic liberty and opportunity, Considerant
began to gather his forces from a Europe, blind,
&ldquo;timorous and enslaved to routine ... despotic even in
its aims of liberty and life.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have never been, in Europe, the abettors of disturbance,
or the creators of disorder. We have there
been diligent laborers in the good cause, the devoted
soldiers of the interests of humanity. America! Free and
Republican! was it a crime in us to have wished for
Liberty and a Republic for Europe? And would it not
be monstrous, should she repel us because we have been,
at home, the martyrs of the very cause of which she
bears the glorious banner in the face of the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor Considerant, <i>European Colonization in Texas</i>,
p. 27.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER III
<br />THE SOCIETY</h2>
<p>The over enthusiastic praise of Texas, its lands, its
climate, and its opportunities in an economic sense
should stamp Considerant as a promoter, if it were not
for the caution with which he approached the formation
of the colony. After serious investigation, it will appear
to anyone that he was effusive by nature and his praise
was sincere; no flattering statement was made by him to
induce people to part with their money, or to participate
in the Texas adventure. In fact, his first appeal to
the French socialists to immigrate in mass to Texas
contains a warning to those who contemplated investing
money in the venture. He said that he had always
with obstinate sincerity exposed the illusion of attributing
to a first scientific experimental establishment the
character of a profitable investment.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_1" href="#fn_3_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, he warned that: first, the establishment
must be considered as a costly experiment; second,
that little or no returns on the money invested could be
expected; and third, it would require very extensive
co-operation to avoid compromising individual fortunes.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_2" href="#fn_3_2">[2]</a>
All colonization, he declares, develops itself at the expense
of those involved and at the risk of each individual
participating in the act. However, colonization requires
a collective principle at its emergence, as an individualistic
principle is altogether too feeble to establish a new
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
home and new economic system in a difficult and distant
state. Communism, he says, has failed, except in rare
cases where the effort was supported by energetic religious
faith, largely because of false theory or poor
conduct in the establishment of the colony. Therefore,
any effort that the Fourierists should put forth should
be worked out completely in theory before the undertaking
is started.</p>
<p>The first necessity for successful establishment,
Considerant thought, was the creation of an agency to
direct colonization. This agency was to have two functions:
first, to acquire lands on which the first settlements
were to be made; second, to prepare these lands
to receive the first immigrants. Preparation was to involve
the purchasing of grain, foods, live stock, implements,
and the erection of houses sufficient to care for
the first groups to arrive. After the advance guards of
the immigrants had been established, they were in turn
to choose other grounds and construct other houses for
the next or succeeding wave of newcomers. This method
would be continued indefinitely, much like the Wakefield
method proposed in England, until the available
lands were taken. Of course, the difference between the
Wakefield method and the one proposed by Considerant
is that Wakefield would have colonization carried on
by the government on money which had been obtained
by the sale of government lands, while Considerant&rsquo;s
scheme provided for collectivism, sanctioned and supported
by private individuals, either as participants in
the act of colonization or as interested observers.</p>
<p>Considerant was an experimenter, and intended the
colony in Texas to be purely an experiment. He definitely
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Although Phalansterians take the initiative in the
work proposed, its object is not exclusively to realize
their ideas, it is more general, it affords the opportunity
of experiment and of practical verification to every
other progressive doctrine, at its own cost, risk and
responsibility.</p>
<p>Let us found in Texas a colony characterized by its
progressive social faith, which shall, first of all, improve
the fruitful resources of a friendly Nature....</p>
<p>We shall not seek to employ, as a means of effecting
the colonization, our own ulterior and definite method
of Social organization.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_3" href="#fn_3_3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, again, he firmly states that it is an ideal of betterment
of humanity that he is seeking and not the bolstering
up of his own pet ideas. If by experiment another
way could be established that would prove more acceptable
than the one he already had under consideration,
he would be willing immediately to adopt the
other plan. Seemingly, Considerant planned the whole
movement as an experiment and investigation into the
social phases of life. He had an idea of social betterment,
which he admitted was no more than a mere
theory, and by means of this colony in Texas, placed
under the most favorable conditions, he could test the
theory.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_4" href="#fn_3_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The aims of the colony as far as settlement is concerned
were, to purchase lands in Texas, to bring a
nucleus of colonists to the new location, and to prepare
the ground for reception of the members of the colony.
Of the latter, Considerant says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To bring ... European colonists upon a virgin soil,
without preliminary arrangements, results, in most
cases, simply in the dispersion of its elements and frequently
in other disasters. In Texas, it is true, that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
dispersion of our colonists would not be their ruin:
they could easily derive advantages from their new position,
but the collective enterprise and its aim would not
the least be missed.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_5" href="#fn_3_5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He thought that the colonists should, as a general
rule, find on their arrival in a new country conditions
equal to those which they left, and that they should
bring with them the reasonable hope that their conditions
would soon be made much better. In order to
insure such a development, Considerant proposes that
there should be two phases of development in the colony.
Americans, already accustomed to the climate and
modes of cultivation practiced in Texas, were to be the
chiefs of the first operations. These chiefs were to be
assisted by volunteer workmen of Europe and America
who expected to participate in the colony and who apparently
were to labor for the &ldquo;faith and interest of the
enterprise,&rdquo; while any lack of helpers was to be supplied
by hired labor, men who were already familiar with
frontier life. The workers were to clear the land, break
the ground, plant the fields, sow the grain, build the
buildings, purchase saw and grist mills at Cincinnati or
Pittsburg and transfer them to the new fields. Livestock
were to be purchased and branded with the mark of the
colony and then turned loose in the fields and the forest
to multiply. In fact, there was to be a fully developed
and operating industrial and agricultural community
already in existence before the Europeans, except &ldquo;skillful
nursery-men, vine dressers and gardeners,&rdquo; ever
arrived in Texas. Considerant writes, in enumerating
what should be prepared, the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. Tenements ready to receive them, and so constructed
as not only to impart a degree of comfort, but
also to satisfy a variety of individual tastes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>B. A complete system of <i>alimentary supplies</i>, which
supposes, besides certain commercial facilities, depots of
provisions, cultures in full bearing, fields sown with
grain, gardens planted with vegetables, and a full stock
of horses, cattle, hogs, sheep and poultry; then, machinery
and workshops fitted to transform the raw
materials into objects of daily consumption,&mdash;mills,
ovens, and kitchens with their utensils.</p>
<p>C. A provision of cottons, woolens, leather, and
other materials for clothing.</p>
<p>D. Such workshops, tools and special implements
of art and industry, not comprised already in the preceding
categories, as may be requisite to the most advantageous
employment of the previously ascertained industrial
capacities of the colonists expected.</p>
<p>E. The creation of a commercial agency for the
sale of the products created by the colony, as well as
for the purchase of objects not produced by it.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_6" href="#fn_3_6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second phase was apparently nothing more than
the Europeans&rsquo; taking possession of what had already
been created, and their continuing to repeat the process
of preparation for others still to arrive.</p>
<p>In spite of the Utopian scheme, the plan would have
probably succeeded in establishing some sort of colony
had not the colonists in America and Europe been too
anxious and rushed in before preparations were made
for them. Instead of waiting and gradually settling the
lands which had been purchased as planned, the colonists
came to unprepared fields and barren hills. This
haste, no doubt, was due in large part to the advertisement
which both Considerant and Brisbane gave the
proposed colony in America and Europe.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_7" href="#fn_3_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>There was one group of bachelors, especially, that
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
Considerant attempted to persuade not to come, telling
them that he would make no agreement with them in
his name or in the name of the society. However, they
disregarded his advice and came to La R&eacute;union. He even
sent Cousin, one of his lieutenants, to several places to
advise groups to wait until a later date for their departure.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_8" href="#fn_3_8">[8]</a>
Nevertheless, when Considerant reached New
Orleans on his way from New York to La R&eacute;union he
learned that more than two hundred colonists were already
on their way to the new establishment&mdash;young
men, old men, old women and young women. They
came from Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, France and
Sweden, all hurrying to the New Utopia which Considerant
had promised them in <i>Au Texas</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_9" href="#fn_3_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>On September 26, 1854, at Brussels, Belgium, the
articles of the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Colonisation Europeo-Americaine
au Texas</i> were signed by Victor Prosper Considerant,
Allyre Bureau, Charles Francois Guillon,
Jean Baptiste Godain-Lemaire, and four others.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_10" href="#fn_3_10">[10]</a> This
was the third society formed by Considerant, the other
two being Considerant, Paget and Company, founded
in 1840, and Considerant and Company formed in 1843.
While these two societies did some colonizing in France,
it was not for this reason that they failed. The chief reason
was the debt which had accrued as a result of publication
of newspapers and other propaganda of the society.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_11" href="#fn_3_11">[11]</a>
One of their undertakings had been the establishment
and support of an orphan asylum in Paris of which
Savardan had control.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_12" href="#fn_3_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>In the new society some arrangements were to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
made to indemnify the people who had worked in these
two societies.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_13" href="#fn_3_13">[13]</a> The unsuccessful outcome of these previous
societies may have been the reason Considerant
took a minor place in the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Colonisation
Europeo-Americaine au Texas</i>.</p>
<p>The first article of the statutes of the society provided
for the establishment of a central agency in Paris, other
agencies in New York and in other places where the
business of the company might justify such an establishment.
Furthermore, it stated the purpose of the society
to be the planting and promoting of a colony as explained
and defined in Considerant&rsquo;s book entitled <i>Au
Texas</i>, published in Paris in May, 1854.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_14" href="#fn_3_14">[14]</a> To carry
out this purpose the society was to purchase or secure
lands in all parts of the State of Texas and to
transport the colonists thereto. It was also to guarantee
development of the colony by collectivism or individualism,
as the members might direct.</p>
<p>The second article provided conditions of investments
of capital and for the payment of dividends resulting
from the operation of the society. The company was
capitalized at $1,000,000 in American money, or 5,250,000
francs, and subscriptions were to be received in units
of five, twenty-five, and one hundred twenty-five dollars.
The subscriptions were to be divided into two groups:
<i>actions a dividendes and actions a prim&eacute;</i>. The former
was divided into three series, to be issued each succeeding
six months period and was to bear interest at the
rate of four per cent. The <i>actions a dividendes</i> were not
to participate in the earnings of the society, with the
exception of ten per cent of the net income, which was
to be set aside to constitute a reserve fund.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Provisions were made in the statutes for the appointment
of an agent in Texas to be the executive
officer of the organization in that state, and who would
be held directly responsible to the governors of the
society. Considerant accepted the proffered position
and was instructed to establish himself in America,
where he was to receive subscriptions and deliver bonds
purchased from the society; acquire or sell in the name
of the society, furniture, tools, and lands; receive payments
and give quittance; agree in courts, and treat with
the states for concessions, or in general to transact any
and all business for the company in America. Furthermore,
he agreed to give the society all concessions made
by him personally while in America, thus removing any
chance of criticism of the conduct of affairs by the
officials. His salary was not to be less than $1,200 per
year.</p>
<p>The life of the charter of the society was to extend
to December 31, 1874, with the possibility of extension
of time, provided two-thirds of the bondholders present
and voting declared such to be their desire. Should no
extension be decided upon, the affairs of the company
would be liquidated.</p>
<p>By article thirty-one of the statutes the society was to
be constituted as soon as the subscription should reach
$100,000, which was declared to have been achieved on
September 26, 1854, when A. Brisbane and Godin-Lemaire
subscribed $20,000 each, Considerant had
brought to the society an undesignated amount.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_15" href="#fn_3_15">[15]</a>
Other people were to be urged to subscribe at least a
million dollars for the proposed colony. In fact, before
leaving Europe in the early part of 1855, Considerant
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
was able to leave knowing that more than $300,000 had
been subscribed for the project, and prospects were good
for the total amount to go beyond $2,000,000.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_16" href="#fn_3_16">[16]</a> Considerant
reported that already more than $80,000 had
been expended upon the first project of the company
at the conclusion of the first year, 1855.</p>
<p>The above amounts were not merely investments in
the form that we understand investments today, they
were payments of &ldquo;rights of participation.&rdquo; That is, a
man bought a certain amount of bonds and this gave
him a right to lands controlled by the company and a
corresponding right to draw from the company&rsquo;s storehouse
a certain specified amount of materials or food, or
as Considerant himself said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A third plan is based on the principle of co-partnership
of different kinds of labor and industry united. In
this system, each one co-operates to create a joint
amount of stock and products, but each member draws
a share proportionate amount of his capital and the
value of his labor. In this combination a separate account
being kept for each person I place confidence, and
I should like to see some experiment made of it, under
favorable conditions.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_17" href="#fn_3_17">[17]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plan was apparently very much like the profit-sharing
plan which many leading industrialists are placing
into operation today, each employee being paid for
his labor and, in addition, receiving an income from the
money which he has invested.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_18" href="#fn_3_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>In order to raise money for the colony, Considerant
realized that he had to depend upon the capitalists
for a great deal of the money, to which many of his
followers objected. However, Considerant pleaded for
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
the co-operation of capital and labor. He wanted the
capitalists to furnish the capital for an interest payment.
The appeal for funds on the ground of gain was made
directly to the men of affairs and not to the potential
settlers; the settlers were to receive freedom, a home,
and higher development. The capitalists and the company
were to receive the profits. The company was to
use the profits to purchase lands and transport additional
colonists, and the capitalists were to use their
money as they pleased. Considerant, in answering those
who charged him with being friendly with the capitalists,
said that he had to have money to operate his society
and if the objectors knew any method whereby he
might obtain the money without interest payment, or
would mention someone to whom he could go to secure
the money, even on interest, he would be glad to accept.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_19" href="#fn_3_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>The first proposal concerning capital was rather
chimerical. As an hypothesis, the sum of $800,000 was
taken as a reasonable amount for the promotion of the
company. With this sum 400,000 or perhaps 300,000
acres of land were to be bought at the price of twenty-five
cents per acre, and within two years 1200 colonists
were to be permanently settled on this land. In addition
the following estimates were made:</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr><td class="l">Grist and sawmills </td><td class="r">$ 6,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Stocks of mechanics&rsquo; tools and fixtures </td><td class="r">5,000</td></tr>

</table>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Thus, there would be a balance of $400,000 in the
treasury for further development of the colony. In order
to make it easy to raise this money there were provided
four ways in which one could invest, viz., (a) invest the
money and reserve the right to participate in the movement
later as a colonist, (b) to become a colonist, (c)
gifts to be paid in installments, (d) people to act as
commercial and colonizing agents.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_21" href="#fn_3_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Such relations in a financial way would determine the
status of a settler after he had arrived at the colony,
and, of course, the settler&rsquo;s own desire as to his relations
with the colony would have some effect. The financial
relations were to be determined by the formation of the
following groups within the colony:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Associates in capital and in labor</dt>
<dt>2. Associates in labor</dt>
<dt>3. Associates in capital, working of their own accord</dt>
<dt>4. Workers not associated, salaried by the association</dt>
<dt>5. Some non-associated, or semi-associated residents working of their own accord</dt>
<dt>6. Pensioners, or boarders, orphans, old and infirm, etc.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Only the first two groups were to have a full fellowship,
the others merely held rights in the company and
participated in its activities in a small degree.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_22" href="#fn_3_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Outside of the above practical and semi-practical purposes,
and underlying the whole idea of the colony was
a theory, novel, interesting, and at times fantastic. In
the first place, the colony was not communistic but
socialistic; that is, a socialism partaking of both present
day socialism and advanced capitalism. Several times
Considerant voiced his objection to communism and
once stated that nearly all new societies had been ruined
by a &ldquo;gross and rudimentary form of Communism.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_23" href="#fn_3_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>In La R&eacute;union a person was to be either worker or
proprietor, and no equal division of earnings was ever
to be made. Each person was to reap the reward of his
own labor, and partake of the profits of the company as
they accrued.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_24" href="#fn_3_24">[24]</a> In fact, the whole success of his program
depended upon unearned increment, and co-operation
with the capitalists in the whole undertaking.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_25" href="#fn_3_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>He proposed, however, very advanced actions which
progressive capitalists accept today, namely, a maximum
and a minimum wage scale to be determined by the members
of the society; co-operation &ldquo;in credit, of exchange,
of mutual insurance, by provisions of cases of sickness,
and social guarantees in behalf of old age and infancy.&rdquo;
These regulations were to be basic, but were subject to
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
change, not being regulatory after the society determined
that there was a need for change.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_26" href="#fn_3_26">[26]</a></p>
<p>Considerant did not object to private establishments,
even being willing to aid them in reaching the new
country and in getting established near the colony. He
thought that if they were to establish themselves in
proximity to the colony it would help increase the value
of the colonial lands. Any benefits derived from collectivism
would also be extended to the individual owners
surrounding the colony. The unified efforts would
be to such a great advantage, it appeared, that no one
would long desire to remain outside. The colonists &ldquo;must
possess every moment, not only an abstract and theoretical
kind of liberty, but a practical guarantee, by the
very nature of organization, of the faculty to detach
themselves from it at their individual pleasure.&rdquo; The
colony was to be an example of co-operation one with
the other. The members could work in communities
practicing &ldquo;individualism&rdquo; and take advantage of the
co-operative organizations in so far as they desired. One
might live several miles from the colony, or he might
live in the colony, and work as an individual or in a
group (phalanx). One could change rapidly from the
individualistic to the co-operative or vice-versa. Anyone
might enter the colony or leave it as he might desire.
No compulsion was to exist, no regulatory demands
made on any person.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_27" href="#fn_3_27">[27]</a></p>
<p>The society itself was not to be exclusive: all other
societies that desired to co-operate&mdash;whether of the same
opinion or not&mdash;had the right to participate. The function
of the <i>European-American Colonization Society</i>
was to prepare a place of liberty and prosperity and to
represent liberal doctrines. Other societies were invited
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
to come to try out their doctrines by experience and
application, and if they were proved workable, then the
Fourieristic society would accept them, for there existed
no right or reason for the members to attempt to impose
any pre-conceived plan upon the colonists. This seemed
to Considerant to be so rational there was no need to
insist upon it.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_28" href="#fn_3_28">[28]</a> However, it seemed to him that there
were certain principles of colonization already established
by the trial and error method recorded in history
which should not be disregarded. These were simple
maxims, such as local self-government, avoidance of
extreme communism, and freedom of action.</p>
<p>Another part of his scheme was that of instruction
or teaching. One day was to be set apart for the teaching
&ldquo;of the social aims and of the common faith, to the
discussion of the general ideas and expressions of the
harmonic or the religious sentiment of the population.&rdquo;
Certain functions that were unitary and of utilitarian
value were to be considered and voted upon by the
whole body, and were to be developed out of the religious
emotions of the people. Favorable attitudes toward
progressive measures were also to be created, taking
care, however, that the whole movement was one of
spontaneity and not one of passive acceptance.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_29" href="#fn_3_29">[29]</a></p>
<p>A university and primary schools were to be provided
wherein the French and English languages and literatures
were to be taught: art, physical and mechanical
sciences were to be taught by men of approved ability,
giving an opportunity to every person to follow the
trend of his own inclinations. A library was also to be
provided, supplied, no doubt, from the expected gifts
of books to be received in subscriptions to the stock of
the company. The whole educational system, however,
was to allow for spontaneous acceptance of the program
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
without any appearance of compulsory education.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_30" href="#fn_3_30">[30]</a></p>
<p>Perhaps the most illusory part of the dream was that
concerning commerce. La R&eacute;union was to become the
center of a gigantic commercial system. Colonies were
to be established in all the states of the union, especially
in the Southwest, and they were to carry on their commerce
with one another, and through the mother colony
connection would be made with Europe. Considerant
visualized great wagon trains winding through the
valleys and over the hills converging at La R&eacute;union with
their loads of foods, metals, and manufactured goods
ready for the European markets. In fact, the shorter
distance from Dallas to the Gulf of Mexico than from
Santa Fe to the same port was one of the determining
factors which led to the selection of the land near Dallas
for the center of this undertaking. At La R&eacute;union the
plan was to have the colony self-sustaining and able to
manufacture various materials for exportation, such as
furniture, pottery, brass work, glass, smelted iron, as
well as articles of food, especially pickles, and meat
products.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_31" href="#fn_3_31">[31]</a></p>
<p>His supreme concept of the colony was expressed as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of a life consumed by cruel anxieties, we shall
have conquered at last the right of Freedom from Care,
which results from the blessed sentiment of solidarity
and which gives to each the consciousness that his individual
life is integrant of the social life. It is the <i>right
to social life</i>, the right to a harmony between the elements
of life, and the being who lives. Each one here
feels himself a member of a social body founded for his
faith and by his faith, destined soon to realize this in
its plenitude, and recognizes himself as an associate and
an active agent in a work whose grandeur penetrates
him deeper and deeper every day.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_32" href="#fn_3_32">[32]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>With such arrangements and connections in Europe
as have been mentioned, and with such a Utopian
plan, Considerant asked for and received letters of
introduction from various men in Europe and the
United States, among whom were H. W. Merrill, Lieut.
Major, U.S.A., and J. J. Seibel of the American Consulate
in Belgium, and came to establish a colony in
Texas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER IV
<br />ATTITUDE OF TEXANS TOWARD THE COLONY</h2>
<p>When Victor Prosper Considerant, the founder of
La R&eacute;union, came to Texas for the first time in 1852
he evidently met with hospitality from all the people,
as his reports show no feeling of having been treated
otherwise. In fact, in his writings he frequently refers
to the kindly interest in, and attitude of the people
toward, his scheme of colonization; especially does he
mention Captain Macy of the United States Army, and
Major Merrill, Commanding Officer at Fort Worth.
However, when he returned to the United States seventeen
months after his first trip to Texas, he found conditions
considerably changed.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_1" href="#fn_4_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The first overtures he made to men of prominence
after his return were very favorable. He says, &ldquo;The cordial
reception and warm support, moreover, which our
first overtures have met with from many eminent persons
in Washington&mdash;senators or representatives from
Texas, former governors and etc., with whom I have had
recently the honor to converse, tended to strengthen me
in my confidence.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_2" href="#fn_4_2">[2]</a> But the masses of the people of the
South and of Texas, had during these seventeen months
which had intervened between the first and second trips,
been over-powered with one of those peculiar psychological
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
phenomena which occur quite frequently in a
nation. This time it was the Know-Nothing Party.</p>
<p>This party grew up almost overnight and became a
strong force in the politics of the nation. The party was a
secret organization which had as its principal theories the
idea that the government of the United States should
be in the hands of &ldquo;Native Americans,&rdquo; that no one
should be permitted to become a citizen until after a
very long period of probation, and that Catholics should
be excluded from all offices. The party gained its largest
number of votes in 1854 and declined rapidly after that
time, being dead in less than three years after its victories
in 1854 and 1855. Such an organization, of
course, could have very little welcome for a group of
French socialists and, in the main, would be openly
hostile toward them.</p>
<p>The rather sensitive and alert Considerant quickly
sensed the change. He immediately issued a statement
concerning the attitude of himself and his colonists in
which he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I by no means intend to criticize or to approve this
political movement, or to pass judgment upon it in any
manner whatever. God forbid that I should follow the
example of those new comers who, having scarcely set
foot on a great country where they find hospitality,
freedom, and an immense field open to their activity,
hasten to take part in its internal affairs, mixing themselves
up in questions of which they cannot yet understand
the first elements, speaking, judging and deciding,
right or wrong, on all sorts of subjects, which demand
long study and profound knowledge of things in order
to be comprehended.</p>
<p>No! my friends and myself, I am authorized to say,
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
are men of common sense. We do not come to America
in order to enlist in parties, of which we know
neither the principles, the traditions, nor the exciting
causes.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly our earnest desire to attain, as soon
as possible, the dignity of American citizens. But we
will patiently wait the time when the law shall accord
to us this title of nobility (whatever delay it may prescribe
us to-day or establish to-morrow). We hold this
title in high esteem, sufficiently to understand that the
law, before conferring it on foreigners, should require
them to become worthy of the privileges; and for ourselves,
we do not pretend to see farther than the Americans
into their own affairs. So far from aspiring to give
them lessons of political conduct, we know that on all
questions of this nature they are our superiors and
masters, and it is our part to place ourselves on the seat
of instruction. We feel ourselves far more urgently
called to cultivate the earth, to erect buildings, and to
establish various branches of industry, workshops, and
schools, than to swell the ranks of any political party,
to deposit our votes in the ballot box, or to place ourselves
in either a scale of the political balance in the
United States, Know-Nothingism, and Anti-Know-Nothingism&mdash;American
Democracy Whiggism, Abolitionism,
Pro-Slaveryism, with all the other isms of the
same nature, are as yet to us only words expressing
ideas, interests, and principles on which we are not
ashamed to confess our ignorance, and to declare our
perfect incompetence. All these questions, we think, are
essentially American, concerning Americans alone, and
in which no foreigner can reasonably take part until
after he has been thoroughly Americanized; and,&mdash;this
is not the work of a day.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_3" href="#fn_4_3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He expressed no fear of the consequences that Know-Nothingism
would have on his scheme. On the other
hand, he analyzed the movement from a political and
social viewpoint and said nothing but good would come
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
out of it if it were conducted in a proper way. He had
been told that the party had as a cardinal principle the
exclusion of all foreigners from the domains of the
United States, but through reading and investigation he
found out the true position of the party, namely, that
it did not particularly desire to exclude foreigners but
to increase the time of their residence within the United
States before conferring political rights upon them.
Their civil rights were not called in question. Considerant
believed the causes for the rise of this party to
be the following: (1) accumulation of slums in larger
cities causing indigent people to become numerous; (2)
lowering of wage scales by incoming immigrants; (3)
the possibility of these indigent new citizens forming a
political block that would destroy American principles
of government; (4) fear of the religious affiliations of
these immigrants of whom practically all were Roman
Catholics.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_4" href="#fn_4_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Considerant either was a novice in his judgment of
American political attitudes and was mistaken concerning
the essential results of the Know-Nothing Party on
foreigners, or he was showing masterful diplomacy. It
seems the former was the case. He always esteemed the
American people very highly, ascribing to them far more
love of liberty and toleration than they possessed. It
seemed absolutely impossible to him that the Americans,
steeped in democracy, would deny newcomers a small
piece of the vast uninhabited wilderness in which to
live, no matter what form of democracy they might
profess. Then too, Considerant trusted the masses, and
like Jefferson, believed that eventually justice and right
would triumph if the people were permitted to decide
the issues of government. However, he was to learn
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
that the hard-working American of 1853 whom he had
met on the frontier and in the cities was a different type
of man from that of 1855 when agitated by political
leaders seeking votes to control the national government.
He met opposition from men from whom he expected
help and especially from the newspapers.</p>
<p>The attitude of the papers of that day toward his
project ranged from the position of vigorous opposition
to that of active support. The <i>Texas State Times</i> and
the <i>Austin State Gazette</i> were the ones most actively
engaged against the colony. The proximity of these
papers to the capitol, where those interested in land
speculation, railroad grants, and other forms of private
privileges came to press their application, perhaps accounts
for some of the opposition, but both papers had
on their editorial staffs men favorable to the Know-Nothing
Party, and furthermore, the highly intellectual
reputation of the French colonists excited the prejudice
of the writers. The <i>Dallas Herald</i> and the <i>Northern
Standard</i> were the two papers most favorable toward
the colonists; also the <i>Galveston News</i> took a favorable
attitude. Outside of Texas the <i>New York Tribune</i> became
one of the prime movers in support of the colony,
while the <i>Washington Sentinel</i> (Washington, D.C.)
was hostile to the socialists. The opposition based its
objections to the colony upon the following four points:
first, socialism, as such; second, the alleged opposition
to slavery on the part of the colonists; third, dislike of
foreigners; and, fourth, Considerant&rsquo;s high intellectual
training, and his request for a subsidy of land in Texas
for his colonists.</p>
<p>In regard to socialism, the <i>Texas State Gazette</i> in its
issue of February 17, 1855, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>We are always pleased to have industrious immigrants
come among us. Plenty of work can be found
by mechanics and laborers, and there is room in all our
towns for more enterprising merchants and business
men. There is one class, however, that we are opposed
to, and have no disposition to hold out to them inducements
to settle among us. This class is of that Propagandist
school which in France and in parts of the
United States, has and is seeking to sap the foundations
of society. The socialist desires to destroy individual
rights in property; and, if he is not a very
intelligent and moral man&mdash;a rare thing,&mdash;we may have
in him a neighbor who will rob and plunder us whenever
he can get the chance; for he holds it as a primary
principle in his creed, that no individual has a right to
accumulate property for himself, and all above what is
necessary to sustain him belongs to the rest of society....
Again, the socialist is an <i>abolitionist</i> everywhere.
He would not be less opposed to slavery by living in
Texas than in France or in Ohio. It is part of his creed.
Now, we are told that John Allen, of Ohio, and Mons.
Victor Considerant, propose bringing out from France
to western Texas a colony of socialists. This move, for
the purpose of building up a sect opposed to our political
institutions, may well be regarded with jealousy,
and the founders may rely upon it that they will not be
suffered to tamper with our institutions. The whole
principle of colonization, where men of a peculiar caste
in religion or politics seek to array themselves together
in particular sections of the country, both as landholders
and factionists, is at war with all the elements of society,
and cannot be carried on without creating bitter
and unrelenting prejudices and animosities among our
native citizens. We note this advent of socialism in
Texas as foreboding us no good; and we wish them to
have a fair understanding before they reach our soil,
that as a political sect, our whole people are against
them.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_5" href="#fn_4_5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The editorial just quoted was apparently read with
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
wide interest all over Texas and the United States.
Considerant, himself, read the article in New York and
made a reply to the criticism; the <i>Washington Sentinel</i>
(Washington, D.C.) entered a long editorial in its
column in support of the stand taken by the <i>Texas State
Gazette</i>; and, as a further indication of interest, the
writers of the editorial in the <i>Gazette</i> received numerous
letters praising them for the position which they had
taken against the socialists.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_6" href="#fn_4_6">[6]</a> The <i>Washington Sentinel</i>
stated that no paper had been more earnest in defending
the rights of naturalized foreigners and in insisting upon
the supremacy of the constitution than it had, but there
were certain interferences that even it could not and
would not submit to, and this interference was socialism.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_7" href="#fn_4_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>On June 2, 1855, the <i>Texas State Gazette</i> again called
the attention of the people of Texas to the serious danger
which confronted the citizens of the state by permitting
the socialists to establish themselves among the people.
In an article, &ldquo;The Socialist in Texas,&rdquo; the paper declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have had enough discussion of the principles of
Socialism from Greeley, Brisbane, and other fanatics
and abolitionists, to know what Socialism must be in
Texas, and how it will finally end.</p>
<p>When men get tired of the glorious institutions of
our republic, there is something wrong with them, themselves,
radically. They are certainly good enough to
protect us in our life, our liberty and pursuit of happiness.
Whatever may be their <i>new views</i>, they are at
least not the class of men to do a state any good. We
have had occasion before to allude to the importation
of foreign Socialists into Texas, and the opinions we
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
have expressed have certainly undergone no change.
We believe them to be a mischievous element of population,
and did we not believe that their wild theories
would not long stand the test of experiment, and would
soon be abandoned, we might urge our objections more
seriously than we have done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same article was a letter from a man who
signed himself J.L. from the city of Washington.
The writer of the letter mentioned that he had seen a
short article in a northern paper in which the attitude
of the <i>Gazette</i>, as expressed in a former editorial, was
very unfavorable to the &ldquo;settlement of a colony of
Fourierestes under the auspices of M. Considerant,&rdquo; in
Texas. He appealed to the &ldquo;Southerners of Texas, not
to permit that band of lawless and unprincipled foreigners
to settle in their midst,&rdquo; and listed reasons why his
appeal should be heeded as follows:</p>
<p>1. That it is the purpose of the Socialists to overthrow
all constituted government and establish instead
a system in which the members would &ldquo;follow the
tendencies of their passions and inclinations regardless of
any restraint of laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. That they were opposed to the Christian code of
morals as stated in the decalogue, because that would
check their passional liberty.</p>
<p>3. That they were all infidels.</p>
<p>4. That they condemned marriage relations and
wherever they dared to do so, &ldquo;openly avow promiscuous
intercourse of sexes, accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5. That they were abolitionists of the most vile
stamp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>6. That they would divert individual property to
their own peculiar organizations.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_8" href="#fn_4_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Considerant answered these charges in a very dignified
way in a pamphlet published in New York.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_9" href="#fn_4_9">[9]</a>
However, he was astonished at the attitude of the
papers and asked, &ldquo;why are we so precipitately attacked
by persons to whom we are entirely unknown, and who
have been informed of our projects only by vague
rumors?&rdquo; Why such an attitude could be held by people
of a free land against Europeans fleeing persecution was
a mystery to him; however, he sought to answer it on
two grounds, namely, a crusade of private interest, and
on the ground of ignorance.</p>
<p>In his answer the Texans were assured that the immigrants
did not desire to leave the theatre of European
struggles, to seek a theatre of other struggles in Texas.
They came to Texas seeking liberty and peace and were
seeking a place remote from civilization where the ideals
of their society could be developed in peace and security.
If such a place was not secured for them in Texas, they
would be forced to seek other climes, either in North
America or Central America, even though such a movement
was repugnant to them as they had already selected
Texas as their adopted home. Considerant derided the
<i>Texas State Gazette</i> in that it appeared to believe that
the socialists were to make an assault on Texas and, as
mere barbarians, invade and destroy it. Such an absurd
idea! These gentle and civilized folk&mdash;more so than the
Texans&mdash;were too mild-mannered barbarians to wish
to harm or disturb anyone.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_10" href="#fn_4_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Such a wrong implication seemed so foreign to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
sympathetic nature of Texans that Considerant was
inclined to excuse the attack on the ground of ignorance.
There were two errors in the statement of the <i>Gazette</i>,
he contended, one of fact and one of logic. The error
of fact was that there were several kinds of Socialists,
and two divisions of the Fourieristic type, one favoring
private property and another opposing it. The larger
group of Fourierists, especially the colonists coming to
Texas, were those who believed in possession of private
property. In fact, the leaders of the former group had
carried on several extensive debates and had written
articles against those favoring the abolishing of private
property. The error of logic was that the paper reasoned
from the assumption that because the immigrants did
not believe in private property they would in turn rob
and pillage their neighbors who possessed property. He
stressed the fact that the men immigrating to the United
States in his colony were men of honor and accomplishments
and were not suddenly going to turn robbers and
marauders. However, Considerant did not ask for any
special forbearance and importuned the Americans for
but one thing, namely to assure to the colonists the
protection of their lives and the property which they
hoped to acquire.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in spite of such declarations, when the
pamphlet reached Texas, perhaps in July or August of
1855, the attack of the newspapers became even more
severe. The <i>Texas State Gazette</i>, in an article in which
sarcasm rather than dignity was displayed, attacked
Considerant personally. Of him it was said that he
possessed the traits of a diplomat instead of those of a
philosopher; that he was cunning and ingenuous rather
than dignified and learned. His good face was presented
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
to the Texans and his bad face was kept in the background,
but his &ldquo;supercilious airs&rdquo; and &ldquo;unabashed self-sufficiency&rdquo;
were evident to anyone reading the pamphlet.
Fear of socialism seems to be the predominant
note in the long editorial. In one place the editor says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We would rather see the State a howling desert than
witness the spreading waves of Socialism stretch itself
over the Christian Churches and the Slave Institution
of Texas. To hold out inducements to these Socialists
is to take steps to make every part of the State where
they may inhabit, undesirable for settlement to Southern
citizens of other States, and as the Socialist increases,
must we look forward to the repulsion and
retirement of slave-holders. It is an excellent initiatory
step for Northern Agressionists and may be flatteringly
successful, if we lack the nerve at the present time to
withhold our disapproval.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_11" href="#fn_4_11">[11]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Texas State Times</i>, in a more dignified and reasonable
manner discussed the pamphlet. The writer referred
to the work as &ldquo;an ably written address to the
American people upon the subject of European colonization
in Texas.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_12" href="#fn_4_12">[12]</a> But in a sarcastic vein it is shown
how Considerant desires to better the condition of a
&ldquo;Heaven deserted state ... by the introduction of
mechanical arts among its rude people, and designing
to fruitfully occupy their leisure moments by illustrating
the practical workings of diverse new and improved
social systems.&rdquo; The editor further states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The deep interest which this modern reformer manifests
towards everything in America in general, and
in Texas in particular, and the unselfishness with which
he avows his willingness to bring his colony, with all
their capital, ingenuity, industry, virtue, and vices, too,
we suppose, and settle them in our midst, in consideration
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
of a grant of our worthless lands, would excite
our gratitude, if we were not convinced that quite a
sufficiency of this description of better citizens reach
our shores through the usual medium of emigration,
without the aid of any special agent, and that European
malcontents can spread the slow but certain poison
of their obnoxious principles quite rapidly enough for
the good of this country, when they come singly and
in couples, without this wholesale importation.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_13" href="#fn_4_13">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it was the fear of dissemination of socialistic
principles that stirred the writer to warn his fellow
countrymen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dissemination of any set of principles antagonistic
to an existing government, must inevitably decrease
the strength and vigor of that government, be it
democratic or monarchial, in the same ratio that these
principles find defenders and advocates. Wherever
doctrines, however preposterous and destructive to
society, have been broached by men of mind, they have
never failed to find disciples.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_14" href="#fn_4_14">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The principles which Considerant was advocating
were such, the writer said, as the &ldquo;vilest Red Republicans
of France have repudiated, in the most licentious
and stormy days of that wavering government.&rdquo; Even
though the whole scheme was to be experimental it
would be very much better, so the writer thought, that
such experiments should be done by &ldquo;our own people
rather than by a deputation of French philosophers&rdquo;
whose attempts to &ldquo;half-sole and heel-tap society in days
gone by&rdquo; had ended in miserable failure.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_15" href="#fn_4_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>There were papers, however, that did not fear socialism
and were anxious to see the experiment tried in
Texas. The <i>Galveston News</i> even thought that the
experiment might discover or explain certain social regulations
that would bring to humanity &ldquo;greater happiness
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
and a higher degree of civilization.&rdquo; But in such statements
there existed in the mind of the writer a certain
pessimism for he says, &ldquo;Discord, which creeps into all
human organization, may cause it to riot in infamy.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_16" href="#fn_4_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Even so, the colony was not sufficiently large or powerful
to cause any serious dangers to the republican institutions
of Texas. <i>The Dallas Herald</i> favored the colony
because of the profit which would come to the city of
Dallas and the surrounding country from the manufactories
which Considerant proposed to establish.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_17" href="#fn_4_17">[17]</a>
The fact, though, that the men who were to form the
colony were republicans who had been expelled from
France because of their sentiments struck a responsive
chord in the minds of the Dallas editors, and caused
them to issue a general welcome to the colonists and
express hope for their success. <i>The Standard</i> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For ourselves only, we say that we think the immigration
of such a class of persons as he describes would
be eminently beneficial to the State, and tend to its
enrichment, by the introduction of Manufactures, without
which no State is truly independent, and free from
tribute in an eminent degree to other States. The agriculture,
manufacturing and commercial elements all
confined in a body politic, give it great power as the
result of great resources&mdash;Texas has the elements for
the successful development of all three, to which may
be added mining in coal and iron.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_18" href="#fn_4_18">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The support of the <i>New York Tribune</i> perhaps did
Considerant more harm than good, as the Southern
papers were suspicious of anything with which Greeley
was connected. The mere fact that Brisbane and Greeley
favored the colony was enough to convince most people
in the South that the colony was organized for the sole
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
purpose of establishing Free-soilers and Abolitionists in
the slave states.</p>
<p>In fact, all the papers, even those supporting Considerant,
were unanimous in their condemnation of the
anti-slavery sentiment as expressed by Considerant. The
<i>State Gazette</i> on October 13, 1855, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a matter of deep solicitude to all Southern men,
that these Socialists should know in advance the opinions
and views of our people. We are far from being
fit subject for the transcendental theorists of the North
and of France. The thousand isms of the day find no
congenial soil in the South, and besides this, the hatred
of the Slave Institution, cherished by these Socialists
and avowed openly by them in our State, must only
the more remind us of our duty and awake us to action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was said in the same issue that socialists were to
be emptied upon Texas by the thousands, and already
that their surveyors were working through several
counties in which the colony had secured nearly every
available piece of ground. Rumor had it that the slave-holders
who lived near these people thought it opportune
to dispose of their slaves, and many Southerners were
disposed to leave their homes and seek plantations farther
West.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_19" href="#fn_4_19">[19]</a> Such statements apparently were wide of
the mark as investigation fails to produce a single protest
from people in the vicinity of the colony; such
exaggeration merely represents the usual effort of some
editors and newspapers to carry their points in any
sensational issue and should not be given credence here.
The incongruous statements of the <i>Washington Sentinel</i>
are amusing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a great country, interminable in extent,
blessed with every variety of climate, and adapted to
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
every kind of production. We have vast uninhabited
wilds that resound oftener with the tread of the buffalo
or the howl of the wolf than with the step or the voice
of the man. We have room for the oppressed, the
enterprising, the industrious and the patriotic of every
clime and country. They are welcome. We would say
to them, come&mdash;our arms are open to receive. Come
... and be naturalized into our free American brotherhood.</p>
<p>Yet when an effort is made to plant amongst us, and
that, in a slave State (Texas) a colony of French Socialists
and abolitionists (they are endorsed by the <i>New
York Tribune</i>) then we demur, most positively and
absolutely.</p>
<p>We want no abolition <i>plantations</i> or <i>colonies</i> here,
whether they are foreign or native. We want no European
ideas of liberty. We carved out, by our own
strong arms, the independence of this country, and we
want nothing of foreign origin infused into our system.</p>
<p>But Socialists are system-makers, government builders,
and communists&mdash;they are political incendiaries
and propagandists, and would not only plant themselves
and their social institutions upon our soil, but would
endeavor insidiously and furtively to erect the system
of government which they espouse, on the same soil.
Their system is altogether different from our system....
Besides, it is an abolition system. It is useless for
M. Considerant or M. Anybody else to attempt to disguise
it. They want to get a foothold here, and they
will adopt any means to do so. It is vain for M. Considerant
to attempt to hide his purposes under the rubbish
of pedantic and scholastic phrases. Those purposes
are plain and palpable.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_20" href="#fn_4_20">[20]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above article was based largely upon Considerant&rsquo;s
declaration against slavery contained in his pamphlet,
<i>European Colonization in Texas</i>, in which he stated
that &ldquo;The evil of slavery should not be increased by an
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
addition of peculiar grants.&rdquo; Considerant well understood
that the slavery question would soon drive the
North and South into war if it were not settled by some
scientific formula rather than by the hot heads of either
side. Personally, he wanted to see slavery abolished
gradually. He was influenced in this position, no doubt,
by Brisbane, who suggested as early as 1840 that a
special investigation should be made into all slavery or
involuntary servitude to determine whether it was economically
sound to have such an institution. If it were
found to be economically unsound or unjust to the men
so penalized, then some plan should be worked out
scientifically for its abolition.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_21" href="#fn_4_21">[21]</a> The charge of many
of the Southern papers that Considerant had been influenced
by Greeley, Brisbane, and other liberal leaders
of the North in the formation of his American political
attitudes cannot be gainsaid. However, the wide political
and basic fundamentals of his concept of social
and political relations were European, and that of the
extreme liberal school. Slavery was certainly against all
his doctrines concerning the political and social equality
of man, but he was not a fanatic on the subject as were
many of the Northern and Southern leaders.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_22" href="#fn_4_22">[22]</a></p>
<p><i>The State Gazette</i> referred to his statement of his
position on slavery as &ldquo;traitorous&rdquo; and said that he was
merely using &ldquo;honeyed words&rdquo; to cover up his &ldquo;pernicious
dogmas.&rdquo; The prejudiced attitude of mind of
the editors is evidenced in the editorials in the <i>Gazette</i>.
They state that Considerant&rsquo;s term &ldquo;social relation of
humanity&rdquo; meant nothing more than &ldquo;nigger good as
white man&rdquo; and that his proposal for a &ldquo;scientific and
peaceful progress&rdquo; of the settlement meant &ldquo;the development
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
of this fact in the legislature.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_23" href="#fn_4_23">[23]</a> Seemingly conscious
of the fact that many of Considerant&rsquo;s arguments
and pleas were unanswerable by reasonable arguments,
the papers resorted to sarcasm and appealed to the prejudice
of an inflamed public sentiment. It was not mere
neutrality on the slavery question that was demanded;
it was actual participation in the agitation for permanence
of the institution.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_24" href="#fn_4_24">[24]</a> Such activity would not have
been possible from the colonists&rsquo; viewpoint because Considerant
had distinctly declared against any active participation
in the politics of the nation until the members
of the colony had become thoroughly conversant with
its problems, nor would such participation have been
acceptable to the South which was at this particular
time largely dominated by the &ldquo;Know-Nothing&rdquo; attitude
toward the foreigner.</p>
<p>During the time that Considerant was trying to establish
his colony in Texas, Albert Brisbane, his chief lieutenant
in the United States, was having a very difficult
time in New York. On one occasion the police, urged
on by the usual anti-socialist complaint of that day,
raided a meeting at which Brisbane was speaking. The
<i>New York Tribune</i> in describing the scene said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nervous young gentlemen, destitute of hats, and bemoaning
rent gloves and departed overcoats, dashed
about to and fro in confusion&mdash;In Broadway, around
the doors of Taylor&rsquo;s saloon, and thickly packed up the
sidewalks of nearly the distance of a block, stood an
expectant crowd, who had got the wind of the fun that
was to be heard of above, and who watched with intense
eagerness the egress of one victim after another in
the relentless grasp of the Police. As the female members
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
of the club emerged from the doors, like a flock of
frightened sheep chased by wolves, the Police followed
closely in their tracks, the crowd raised loud shouts,&mdash;&ldquo;Make
way for the Ladies;&rdquo; &ldquo;Here they come;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Three
Cheers&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Let us see them&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hoo-Raw for
the Free Lovers,&rdquo; etc., etc., etc.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_25" href="#fn_4_25">[25]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attitude of the legislature of Texas is very interesting.
This attitude, perhaps, can best be explained
by the study of a petition presented by Considerant and
by the report of bills in the House and the Senate. Ignorance
on the part of the legislators of the purposes and
policies of the colony is astonishing, and this ignorance
existed in spite of the fact that Considerant had done
everything to inform them of his purpose and policies.
At one time he distributed to the members his pamphlet
on <i>European Colonization in Texas</i> which went into
detail concerning the proposed colony. Savardan, in his
book, states that this distribution was the greatest mistake
made by Considerant because he took a neutral
stand on political problems, especially on slavery. This,
Savardan explains, was the very thing that Texans, especially
the legislators, did not want. Conditions and
circumstances in Texas demanded partisan politics and
not neutrality. One must of necessity be for or against
slavery, building of railroads, immigration, and similar
movements.</p>
<p>In December, 1855, Considerant presented a petition
to the House of Representatives and the Senate
setting forth his appeal for grants of land in Texas.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_26" href="#fn_4_26">[26]</a>
In this he said that in returning to Texas for the second
time he found there had been considerable change:
in the public sentiment toward foreigners; in that all vacant
lands in the north part of the state had been taken
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
up by settlers, located on by speculators, or reserved to
the Pacific Railroad Company. Thus the advantage
which he clearly foresaw in 1852 for his colonization
company and which he put forth as inducements in his
reports to his friends to settle in Texas, had practically
vanished, leaving him in a peculiar situation. The reaction
to such a situation in Europe and among his
friends had been such as to endanger the project of colonization.
In consideration of these factors he asked if &ldquo;a
grant, for instance of two hundred sections of land,
made to the Colonization Company, would exceed the
measure of the favor&rdquo; which the state would feel disposed
to extend to the company as encouragement and
compensation for the heavy expenses already undergone
by the company in bringing settlers to Texas. So when
he returned to present the above petition, he found public
opinion aroused opposing his project.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_27" href="#fn_4_27">[27]</a></p>
<p>Considerant, thoroughly realizing this opposition to
him and his colonists in Texas, attempted to answer the
charges brought against him. In a letter to the governor
of Texas, he said that certain persons &ldquo;see only in our
immigration an invasion of fanatics, enemies of property,
of robbers, abolitionists,&rdquo; and that they &ldquo;imagined that
we came to this country with the intention of subverting
her institutions and laws, to bring about the abolition of
slavery, and to create a State within a State.&rdquo; Such
charges were, according to him wholly unfounded, and
could be charged only to &ldquo;persons who had previously
given unmistakable signs of mental aberration.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_28" href="#fn_4_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, in spite of Considerant&rsquo;s pleading and
earnest presentation of facts, the state legislature did not
see fit to grant him lands which he had requested. This
was due perhaps to the change of policy in regard to
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
state lands which had been recently adopted rather than
to any particular objections to the French colonists or
their socialistic doctrines. Of course, as was shown by
newspaper reports, the objection to the colonists was so
great that no land would have been granted even if there
had been no change of policy.</p>
<p>Even though Considerant and others of the colony
labored assiduously for the grant of land and recognition
of the colony, a bill permitting incorporation was all
that they could achieve. On July 19, 1856, the Committee
on Public Lands made the following report concerning
the petition of the colony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Committee on Public Lands, to which was referred
the petition of Victor Considerant, have had the
same under consideration, and instructed me to report
against the prayer of the petitioner; yet they have instructed
me, in virtue of the fact that the petitioner
represents a company with a large capital, and whose
objects are to engage in manufacturing and other
branches of industry, which it is believed will be of
incalculable advantage to this country, to report a bill
incorporating said company for the above purpose and
recommend its passage.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_29" href="#fn_4_29">[29]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, on August 16, such a bill was introduced to
&ldquo;incorporate the European and American Colonization
Society in Texas.&rdquo; Some one immediately moved to
amend the bill by inserting Harrison County and substituting
G. G. Gregg, W. Adair, W. M. Evans. The
amendment was tabled. Still another amendment was
offered to substitute thirty-three and one-third years for
the one hundred years contained in the bill, which
amendment was also lost. Mr. Dickson of Red River,
when his name was called, arose and said,</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>I would like to know what this incorporation
means to do. I don&rsquo;t see any proposition to do any particular
thing. The bill just incorporates a body of men,
without specifying for what purpose.</p>
<p>Now, I understand that this is a French Colony of
Communists, and that those people there work for the
leading men at about twenty cents a day, and are
charged for their provisions, thus coming in debt at the
end of every night.</p>
<p>Without having any explanation of what these people
mean to do, and hearing these things charged
against them, I vote No.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_30" href="#fn_4_30">[30]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bill to incorporate finally passed the House by a
vote of forty-eight to twenty according to the <i>House
Journal</i>, but only forty-three to twenty according to the
records of the <i>State Gazette</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_31" href="#fn_4_31">[31]</a></p>
<p>In the Senate the bill suffered the same fate as to
amendments. On August 25, one was offered which
&ldquo;provided, that this act shall not take effect or be in
force until said Corporation shall (if they be foreigners)
first file evidence in the State Department of their
naturalization.&rdquo; Then another amendment,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provided, that a majority of the directors of said
company, and the President thereof, shall be residents
of Texas, and that the principal office shall be kept in
this State, where all writs and citations shall be served.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then the third amendment,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provided, that this act shall not be so construed as
to entitle said company to the benefit of any law, granting
land or money to any Railroad or Manufacturing
or Colonization Company, nor shall it authorize the
company to prohibit slavery in any territory occupied
by them.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_32" href="#fn_4_32">[32]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bill as amended was voted on and failed of adoption
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
in the Senate by a vote of fifteen for and thirteen
against, two-thirds being needed for its passage.</p>
<p>After the bill failed in passage, Senator McDade
moved for a reconsideration of the vote, but it was laid
on the table for future consideration.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_33" href="#fn_4_33">[33]</a> Later, on August
29, Bryan called upon the Senate to reconsider
the vote on the colony, and was successful in winning
the passage in the Senate, fifteen to seven.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_34" href="#fn_4_34">[34]</a> Then, on
the following day the bill was reported in a list of bills
enrolled&mdash;having been signed by the speaker of the
House and the President of the Senate and being ready
for the governor&rsquo;s signature.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_35" href="#fn_4_35">[35]</a></p>
<p>On September 1, 1856, the bill to incorporate the
&ldquo;American Colonization Society in Texas,&rdquo; was signed
and thus became a recognized act of the State Legislature.
Thus, in spite of the prejudice created by the
newspapers the colony was legally established in Texas,
but the outcome was very discouraging to those who had
expected success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER V
<br />THE IMMIGRANTS</h2>
<p>After the organization of the company in Belgium on
September 26, 1854, immediate preparations were made
to raise money and prepare the colonists for their emigration
to America. Fran&ccedil;ois Cantagrel and a Mr.
Roger, Belgian medical student, left Brussels October
3, 1854, for New York, reaching that port October 27.
Cantagrel&rsquo;s plan was to go overland to Cincinnati where
he was to purchase supplies and equipment for the new
colony. From this place he intended to continue his
journey to Texas, reaching his destination not later than
the latter part of November. However, his progress was
far slower than he expected; he was still on his way in
February, 1855, and presumably did not reach La R&eacute;union
until the latter part of that month.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_1" href="#fn_5_1">[1]</a> The arrival
of Cantagrel and his party was announced as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the leading gentlemen connected with the
French Colony of Messrs. Brisbane and Considerant
are now in town. From them we learn some additional
items in relation to the designs and objects of the association.
It is in contemplation to establish three provisional
settlements; one, probably, in this county, one
in Tarrant, and one on the Keechi or Brazos. A large
number of the settlers for these colonies are now en
route, having left Cincinnati in December last. They
are probably detained by the low stage of the rivers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>We understand that industrial, mechanical, and
learned professions will be fully represented. It is their
design to make everything they use within themselves,
and they will engage largely in manufactures of different
kinds. It is especially their intention we learn,
to engage largely in the cultivation of the grape and
manufacture of wines. Such a settlement in our midst,
of a nation celebrated for its intelligence, genius and
skill in the mechanic arts, cannot fail to add greatly to
its prosperity. Some of the leading republican minds
and most distinguished authors of France, who, since
the usurpation of the &ldquo;Man of the 2nd December&rdquo; have
been exiled from their country for opinion&rsquo;s sake, are
engaged in this enterprise. A welcome and success to
all say we.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_2" href="#fn_5_2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not known just how many were in the party,
but some joined Cantagrel and Roger at Cincinnati and
others were hired along the way to do labor at La R&eacute;union.
Brisbane explained that the work of Cantagrel
was to explore the country and decide on a definite location
for the project, begin the erection of buildings
for the first immigrants, sow crops, prepare gardens,
vineyards, and in general construct the colony.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_3" href="#fn_5_3">[3]</a> He
further stated that it was hoped that &ldquo;a body of
intelligent and enterprising Americans&rdquo; would be &ldquo;attracted
to the work by the noble aim which it holds out,
and the advantages of a higher social life which it
offers.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_4" href="#fn_5_4">[4]</a> Other parties of immigrants soon followed, some
small, some large. One of these parties was reported by
the <i>National Intelligencer</i>, Washington, May 7, 1855,
as having passed through Anderson sometime previous
to the date. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Central Texan says that a party of French emigrants,
about forty in number, passed through Anderson
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
a few days ago enroute to Dallas. They belong to
the Colony which M. Considerant is engaged in establishing.
He proposed to introduce about two thousand
this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>M. Cousin, Belgian, conducted a party of twelve,
eight Belgians and four Frenchmen. One of this party
was a young man named Guelles, son of the French Consul-General
at Jura, who had been exiled to Belgium.
Savardan, who disliked Considerant and his group,
never tired of telling how Considerant and his wife had
persuaded this youngster to accompany the party, even
against the wishes of his mother, who yielded only when
Madame Considerant promised to look after the boy
very carefully. However, once in America, Guelles was
turned loose to manage for himself. He left the colony
to live with some people near by and soon fell ill with
tuberculosis and died.</p>
<p>One of the largest groups was assembled by Dr.
Savardan. He was one of the outstanding disciples of
Fourier in France and had assisted in the formation of
other phalanges. Savardan was ready to leave Brussels
the week Cantagrel left, but he and Considerant could
not agree on terms. Nevertheless, without agreement, he
gathered his party at le Havre and sailed on the <i>Nuremberg</i>,
a ship of 1800 tons, on February 28, 1855. Savardan
had forty-three people and a considerable amount
of material which he was bringing to La R&eacute;union. There
were five members of this party from Jura who remained
in New Orleans and did not finish the trip, eleven from
Carcassonne, three from the Hautes-Alps, three from
Ardennes, four from Chateau-Renault, seven from
Mons, one from Orleans, one from Rouen, four from
Paris, and four from Chapelle-Gaugain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>They all had a very pleasant trip which took its course
from le Havre to the Azores, where they passed on
March 12, through the West Indies, and from thence to
New Orleans. Here the <i>Nuremberg</i> stopped and the
colonists and materials were loaded on to another ship
bound for Galveston. On April 25, Dr. Nicolas, one of
the leaders, and ten others left for Galveston because
they could not any longer endure the stifling heat at
New Orleans. Savardan and the other colonists tarried
a few days longer in order to purchase supplies for the
party for the remainder of the trip. The purchase consisted
of:</p>

<p>The total weight amounted to 7000 pounds and cost,
including freight charges to Dallas, $1,000.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_5" href="#fn_5_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The party embarked from New Orleans on May 3
with five women and one young man, Christopher,
added to the party. Savardan had been advised that
Considerant and his family would join his group at New
Orleans, but they did not arrive. However, they joined
them later at Galveston. Considerant brought with him
his wife, a small child, M. Cesar Daly, and two other
Frenchmen from the North American Phalanx named
Maguet and Willemet. Galveston was reached May 5,
and from here they sailed on a small steamboat, the
<i>L&rsquo;Eclipse</i>, up Buffalo Bayou to Houston. Here additional
wagons and horses were purchased and teamsters
were hired to take the provisions, some of which had
been sent from New York, Cincinnati, and New Orleans,
to La R&eacute;union.</p>
<p>On May 18, the French wagon train, guided by a
farmer who lived near Dallas and who had come to
Houston to sell two bales of cotton, moved out through
the woods toward Dallas. Some of the colonists were
riding horses, two or three riding in carriages, and some
were walking. A few of the men who had been drafted
as teamsters were laboring with oxen, trying to get them
to move along. Poorly built wagons and the absence of
roads greatly hindered progress. They camped at night
all together for protection against Indians, the women
and children sleeping in the wagons and the men and
boys on the ground. Eggs, milk, and poultry were purchased
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
at farm houses as the caravan traversed the
sparsely settled districts; some stealing was done, but,
generally speaking, the colonists conducted themselves
well on the entire trip.</p>
<p>All the way from Houston to La R&eacute;union Savardan
reports the colonists were expecting welcoming groups
from La R&eacute;union to come out and meet them. This, of
course, never occurred because the people already at
camp were finding it difficult to keep things going.
They arrived at La R&eacute;union June 16, 1855.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_6" href="#fn_5_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Several other groups and individuals arrived at La
R&eacute;union during the following eighteen months. In fact,
many arrived just in time to see the colony disband, leaving
them to shift for themselves. Philip Goetsel, a Belgian,
had a ranch of seventeen sections on Mountain
Creek, twelve miles west of Dallas, on which he established
a colony of Belgians. Several cabins were built on
low lands which were subject to overflow; other improvements
were made, but the colony never did become
more than a dependency of La R&eacute;union. Goetsel, however,
planned to build a huge city upon the land, which
he proposed to name Louvain in honor of his home city
in Belgium. He had invested thirty thousand francs in
La R&eacute;union and when he noticed that it was going to
pieces, he demanded his money with the intention of
investing it in the &ldquo;Louvain scheme.&rdquo; The directors of
La R&eacute;union refused him his share on the grounds that
he was building Louvain in opposition to La R&eacute;union
and that it would draw all the trade away from the community
stores of the colony.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_7" href="#fn_5_7">[7]</a> Still another party, time
of arrival uncertain, was the one led by M. M. Raizant
composed of nine people. These apparently came by
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
New Orleans and Galveston, perhaps preceding Savardan&rsquo;s
party.</p>
<p>La R&eacute;union was made up of high class, well educated
and cultured people. A brief biography of the founders
of the colony has already been given in the first chapter
of this book, but a short sketch concerning several will
here serve to give the reader a better comprehension of
the colonists as a group.</p>
<p>Dr. Augustin Savardan had already helped to establish
phalansteries in France before coming to Texas. He
had also organized and supervised an orphans&rsquo; home in
Paris which Napoleon III had helped to sustain. He was
one of the first men Considerant and his colleagues called
into conference in Brussels when they began the organization
of the European-American Colonization Society,
and they asked him to act as chairman in one of their
first meetings. In his report of his practice as a physician
at La R&eacute;union, he stated that he treated 226 patients
and served in many other capacities during his stay
here.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_8" href="#fn_5_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Julien Reverchon came from a distinguished family
in France.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His father, J. Maximilien Reverchon, was born at
Lyons in 1810, and died at Dallas in 1879; and his
mother (born Mlle. Florine Pete) was the daughter of
a distinguished Lyonnaise advocate. Julien&rsquo;s grandfather,
Jacques Reverchon (1746-1829), was a Jacobin
member of the National Convention (1792-95), as well
as the Council of Five Hundred and of the Council of
Elders. This Jacques Reverchon the <i>revolutionnaire</i>
is that same citizen-representative from Saone et Loire,
Rhone-et-Ain, whose reports on the rapacity of the
Maratists at Lyons have been quoted in Taine&rsquo;s <i>Les
Origines de la France Contemporaine</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_9" href="#fn_5_9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Julien and his father came to La R&eacute;union as members
of a colony arriving there in December, 1856. The
father was a trained agriculturist and attempted to direct
the colonists in scientific farming. He told them that if
they would plow and stir the land deep in the fall and
plant early in the spring, good crops would be produced.
The men, however, were inexperienced in farming and
Reverchon had little success. Nevertheless, in spite of
the most severe drought that Texas had experienced in a
long time, Reverchon grew crops, planted fruit trees,
and introduced advanced methods in Dallas County
farming.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_10" href="#fn_5_10">[10]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most interesting names is that of Fran&ccedil;ois
Santerre, farmer and ex-soldier, who remained with his
wife and children near the colony site, engaged in sheep
raising and farming when the colony disbanded. His
varied interests included a love of books, particularly
of the sixteenth century edition of Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>
which he took with him on six business trips he
made to France.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_11" href="#fn_5_11">[11]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This book, among others, was in the possession of his
son, Gustave, former owner of the La R&eacute;union Fruit
Farm. His eldest son, Germain, was one of two surviving
immigrants in 1930, the other being M. Guilbot,
who lived near Alvarado.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_12" href="#fn_5_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>There is partial information concerning several others
who were outstanding in the colony. Madame Clarisse
Vigoureaux, mother-in-law of Considerant, was author
of several books, and also intensely interested in Fourierism.
Emile R&eacute;mond was a scientific farmer and writer
on soils. A recent writer in explaining what R&eacute;mond did
in Dallas County says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clay resources of Dallas County very early attracted
the attention of the pioneers, particularly the
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
French, who settled the French town of La R&eacute;union
west of Dallas in 1854. Prof. E. Remond (1840-1906)
of this colony was particularly active in his investigation
and experiments with the clays of the county. He
made successfully brick, vitri-brick, and sewer pipe.
Prof. Remond was the first to import a plastic brick
machine. He was also first to use the lime and shale for
making concrete and instigated the founding of the Iola
Cement Plant. Remond made brick in South, East, and
West Dallas, at Dawdy&rsquo;s Ferry and Mountain Creek.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_13" href="#fn_5_13">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allyre Bureau, a director of the colony, was a trained
musician who had been director in the Odeon, a national
theater in Paris. He tried to revive the dying colony in
1856, but failed, and started to return to France toward
the close of the Civil War in the United States. He contracted
yellow fever near Houston and died in a sanitarium
located about fifty miles north of that city. Several
architects were in the group, among whom may be
mentioned Ureidag, Flemish, who submitted plans for
the Dallas County Court House, and John B. Louchx,
who was later alderman and one of the fourteen bachelors
who came to build houses and prepare the ground
for the coming of other colonists. Ben Long came from
Zurich, Switzerland, and later introduced a group of
Swiss colonists in Dallas. Before his death, killed while
serving as a Dallas officer, Long served as United States
Commissioner, as Mayor of Dallas, and as an officer in
the Sheriff&rsquo;s office.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_14" href="#fn_5_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Texas and Dallas were very fortunate in having a
group of men and women possessed of such attainments
settle in their midst. Generally speaking, Considerant
was correct when he estimated that the French colonists
who were planning to come to La R&eacute;union were far
ahead in culture and learning of the average Texas settlers
in the state at that time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>On February 10, 1855, however, the <i>Texas State
Gazette</i> expressed in an editorial a feeling of uneasiness
when it announced that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a recent letter from Strausburg, which
is published in the National Gazette of Switzerland, the
Socialist Party in Alsace is about to emigrate en masse
to Texas, where one of their chiefs, the well known
Victor Considerant, has purchased a large quantity of
land. The departure of emigrants is to take place during
the ensuing year.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_15" href="#fn_5_15">[15]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as can be determined, there is no roll of the
colony in existence, and thus statements of the survivors
and descendants of those in the colony must be taken as
authority on the number who made up the colony. One
writer refers to a roll containing over three hundred
names formerly in the possession of the colonists. This
roll, however, has been lost and the writer had to depend
upon the memory of the colonists and lists given in
various articles. Some of the survivors stated that there
were as many as 550 people in La R&eacute;union, but it appears,
through a process of checking and rechecking, that
the above-mentioned roll was perhaps the complete roll
of the members, and therefore there were no more than
three hundred in the colony at any one time&mdash;perhaps
that number included all that ever lived in the colony
during its existence.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_16" href="#fn_5_16">[16]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VI
<br />LA R&Eacute;UNION, THE COLONY</h2>
<p>La R&eacute;union was located three to four miles west of
the Dallas county court house near what is generally
termed the &ldquo;Old Fort Worth-Dallas Pike,&rdquo; on the south
bank of the Trinity River. The ground is now occupied
by a small settlement, Cement City, and several farms.
The soil is poor as compared with other lands surrounding
Dallas, but the location is very attractive as to
scenery. The hills and valleys are still partly wooded
with elm and blackjack, and must have been more so
eighty years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_1" href="#fn_6_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The Dallas site was really second choice as the original
plan was to settle in Cooke County. However, arriving
in Cooke County several months after the first visit,
the agents for the colony found all the land already
occupied or claimed by speculators, railroad companies,
and American colonists. This forced the selection of
another location, since the company did not feel justified
in paying a large sum for land that could be obtained
elsewhere more reasonably. Victor Prosper Considerant,
founder of the colony, had spent two weeks near the
Dallas location in 1853 in the home of Mr. Gouhenans
and was favorably disposed toward accepting it as the
site for his future colony. Roger, another leader of the
colony, later joined Considerant in insisting on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
choice. Allen, Cantagrel, and other members wanted to
settle at Fort Worth, at Belknap, and even farther west,
but upon the insistence of a few of the colonists, supported
by Considerant, the Dallas site was chosen and
further search was abandoned.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_2" href="#fn_6_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The ground occupied in Dallas County consisted of
various surveys from time to time, but the actual ownership
never surpassed a few thousand acres. On January
7, 1855, James Knight of Fort Bend County conveyed
to Considerant one league and labor of land, which was
probably the first land purchased at the price of one
hundred dollars for 320 acres. Finally, during the following
year, a map of the proposed La R&eacute;union with a
description of its survey was placed on record in the
Dallas County courthouse.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_3" href="#fn_6_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>This land was at first controlled by Considerant and
was listed in Dallas County records as his personal property.
Such an arrangement was in full accord with the
agreement made between Considerant and the company
in Belgium before he came to the United States as an
agent with full power, acting for the European-American
Colonization Company. In fact, he agreed with the
company that any and all purchases of whatever nature
made by him while in America would become the property
of the company.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_4" href="#fn_6_4">[4]</a> This was done so that no one
would be able to accuse him of using the funds of the
company or his official position for his own personal
advancement.</p>
<p>There were some advantages in the choice of land,
but the disadvantages were far greater than the advantages,
the colonists later learned. For water the
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
settlers had to depend largely upon fissure springs coming
from the Austin Chalk formation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In these springs the water which collects along certain
of the more porous layers of the chalk rock is permitted
to come to the surface along the more or less
open fissures between the faulty blocks. Sometimes
wells were dug in draws and low drain ways, which
wells were often unsanitary as was shown by the number
of cases of fever amongst the colonists during their
stay in La R&eacute;union.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_5" href="#fn_6_5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Savardan hints in several places in his book that Considerant
did not want to develop this land&mdash;this, however,
appears unwarranted. The facts seem to be that
the French colonists were not able financially or otherwise
to develop the phalanstery or the land as it should
have been developed.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_6" href="#fn_6_6">[6]</a> Inexperience, lack of capital, and
the climate all contributed to the lackadaisical policy
which was followed.</p>
<p>Considerant had explained in his <i>Au Texas</i>, to those
who contemplated investing in the company, that La R&eacute;union
was to serve as a center from which would radiate
numerous lines leading to other counties, or even to
other states. Not only were there to be other colonies
growing out of the central foundation, but there was to
be continual in-coming and out-pouring of individuals.
These individuals, having lived in the colony and having
imbibed of its policies, would go out and settle nearby
on new ground, but would retain their connection with
the establishment in a cultural and commercial way.</p>
<p>In line with such a policy, Considerant began almost
immediately to purchase land for such expansion. Savardan
severely criticizes him for this, but such action was
in full accord with Considerant&rsquo;s intention as announced
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
in <i>Au Texas</i>. However, Considerant erred greatly, almost
criminally, by not waiting until La R&eacute;union, which
was to be the center of all activity, was firmly established.
The facts are that he never remained at La R&eacute;union
a sufficient length of time to establish anything
or to become familiar with its problems and possibilities.
The first purchase in the expansion move was made,
May 17, 1855, which amounted to fifty-one and one-eighth
acres near the present city of Houston. This plot
was to be used as a way-station, where incoming colonists
could rest and become acclimated to the Texas
weather.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_7" href="#fn_6_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Some of the prominent leaders at La R&eacute;union wanted
to establish several rest camps along the road from Houston
to La R&eacute;union, but this was never put in operation.
Savardan, the critic, says that A. M. Bussy proposed to
establish stores and gardens from which the incoming
colonists would receive supplies; Considerant not only
opposed this but did not even want a store at La R&eacute;union.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_8" href="#fn_6_8">[8]</a>
On account of the climate and lack of development,
this Houston way-station served little good and
was soon abandoned. Two men, one of whom was a
physician who had been in charge of the camp for a
short time, were forced to leave Houston on account of
a severe fever epidemic. They arrived at La R&eacute;union
weeks later, where Savardan treated the men and
brought them to a slow recovery.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_9" href="#fn_6_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The second extension of the central colony was in
Uvalde County where a purchase of more than fifty
thousand acres was made.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_10" href="#fn_6_10">[10]</a> Some of the settlers wanted
to build the second colony near Fort Belknap. They
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
pointed out that the distance was not more than half
of that to Uvalde, and that better land could be secured
for less than half the price of Uvalde land. In addition
to this, the United States Army would be at hand to
protect them from the Indians which would not be the
case at Uvalde.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_11" href="#fn_6_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>However, Considerant went from Austin, where he
had been working with the legislature trying to get a
grant of land for his colonists, to San Antonio with a
state senator. Considerant was apparently introduced to
a land speculator and developer, who borrowed $10,000
from him. Later Considerant was severely criticized for
this act but he explained that it was a legitimate business
deal. Nevertheless, it appears that he fell into the hands
of clever land speculators who had been introduced to
him by the senator and that he was stripped of the remaining
cash belonging to the company which he had in
his possession. The deal caused considerable criticism
and disagreement among the men at La R&eacute;union.</p>
<p>Considerant answered the criticism by pointing out
the success of the colonists at Castroville, New Braunfels,
and Fredericksburg. These colonies had been established
about ten years, he claimed, and all were successful.
He had visited Belton in 1853, at which time there
was no settlement, but in 1855 many stores and brick
houses had either been built or were under construction.
Hondo also was flourishing and several buildings were
under construction there.</p>
<p>Considerant could dream of phalansteries all over
Texas, linked together by trade and culture, and talk of
a super-race bred from a vigorous and active American
people mixed with the cultured French; in fact, he might
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
be classed as a great dreamer and philosopher, but as a
manager of commercial affairs or as to meeting the land
speculators on even terms, he was a sad failure.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_12" href="#fn_6_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>His financial accounts with the company were, apparently,
always mixed and his dealings with the individual
colonists were never satisfactory. Several men
were sent at various times to investigate and audit his
accounts, but each time at their departure the old system&mdash;rather
lack of system&mdash;would develop again.</p>
<p>When the colonists reached the location where they
expected to find a flourishing colony, buildings, and
growing crops and cattle, they were always disappointed
in finding everything in confusion and disagreement.
This is especially true of those arriving after the first six
months; those coming earlier entered the undertaking
with faith and hope in the ultimate success of the phalanstery.
Both Albert Brisbane and Considerant, chief
proponents of the colony, had urged the company agents
and prospective colonists not to hurry over until all
preparations had been made to receive them. Furthermore,
Considerant urged the agents over and over again
not to send out men who were not farmers; it was his
purpose to form an agricultural colony and introduce
industry only as needed. However, both the agents and
the people disregarded this advice; no farmers were sent,
and the colonists were thrust upon Considerant before
any preparations had been made. Becoming discouraged
over the prospects, within a few months after the beginning
of the establishment, Considerant wrote to
France advising that further plans be suspended as the
colony would very likely cease operation.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_13" href="#fn_6_13">[13]</a> Nevertheless,
La R&eacute;union was established and those people arriving
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
from Europe set immediately to work constructing
houses in which to live. The town which was built
on the grounds was nothing like the phalanstery which
had been proposed.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_14" href="#fn_6_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>The following quotation shows that in addition to
the President&rsquo;s office, in April, 1856, the colony possessed
several other important buildings,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... a building for making soap and candles, a laundry,
a building for offices, a kitchen, a grocery store, beehives,
a chicken house, a smoke house, a forge, a cottage
for the Executive Agent, and have begun the construction
of two dormitories of eight apartments each,
to be given to different households.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_15" href="#fn_6_15">[15]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three years later, in 1859, a visitor, after describing
the general merchandise store, says, &ldquo;R&eacute;union contains a
fine and commodious store-house, blacksmith shop, hotel,
a bootmaker, tailor and mechanic&rsquo;s shop. Coombs&rsquo; steam
mill is only one mile distance from La R&eacute;union.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_16" href="#fn_6_16">[16]</a> The
same writer, in describing the store, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are indebted to the courteous and gentlemanly
proprietor of the La R&eacute;union store for a lot of choice
cigars and a jar of delicious brandy pears. They have
at La R&eacute;union a well selected stock of new and fashionable
goods, which they are prepared to sell at unreasonably
low prices.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_17" href="#fn_6_17">[17]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1919 a visitor surveying the ruins wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some distance from this structure, possibly 200
yards, were the remains of a store and concrete building
about thirty feet or more square which was the
commissary for the colony; thick walls were still several
feet high on the four sides. Between this ruin and the
residence were outlines of old fence partitions preserved
by indigenous shrubs, prickly pear, hoar hound,
etc., with now and then a plum tree survival.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_18" href="#fn_6_18">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>These buildings were constructed of wood and stone.
Because of lack of knowledge concerning the climate,
the colonists did not realize the necessity of good construction
for protection against the &ldquo;northers&rdquo; and consequently
suffered severely from the cold.</p>
<p>When a sufficiently large group had settled at La
R&eacute;union, the people met to form a society which they
called &ldquo;The Society of R&eacute;union.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_19" href="#fn_6_19">[19]</a> Objectives of this
Society were: acquisition of the domains of La R&eacute;union,
Dallas County, the development of agriculture, the construction
of industrial establishments, and the formation
of a council for making public decisions. The operating
or social fund of the society was fixed at $600,000
representing 4800 <i>actions</i> at $125. The Society of
R&eacute;union was to act as a local office or clearing house
for the business of the colony and to deal directly with
the European Colonization Society of Texas. It was not
to replace or to usurp the prerogatives of the parent
society.</p>
<p>In addition to possessions in the form of buildings, the
Society put into cultivation 430 acres of land; purchased
500 head of cattle, some sheep, pigs, and fowls; dug
wells, built a few short, shallow canals; bought mowing,
reaping, and threshing machines; and secured two half-sections
of land near the settlement. A very large garden
was planted and developed, one that did not justify the
funds invested but excited the curiosity of all who visited
the colony.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_20" href="#fn_6_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>At first the store was successful and apparently did
a very good business, as one report shows an average
of $330 a month business, with profits ranging from
twenty to thirty per cent. This trade came largely from
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
outside the colony, and seems to have been due to the
fact that the store was stocked with better goods more
reasonably priced than those in stores farther from the
surrounding settlers.</p>
<p>There was a co-operative kitchen in which the majority
of the colonists had their meals. During Cantagrel&rsquo;s
directorship the colony had four long tables in the dining
room. On each table was a large bowl of pottage and
one of meat which were passed around in family style.
Quite often, according to Savardan, the bowls reached
the last two or three people completely empty, and there
was no more food to replenish the dish. The men paid
twenty-two sous each day for board; the women eighteen
sous; and children from six to twelve paid twelve
sous; while children under six paid six sous. Savardan
was opposed to the communistic arrangement at the
table for he said such arrangements gave privileges and
thus made &ldquo;nobilities of the great eaters and head
waiters, while the small eaters had to take what was
left.&rdquo; He suggested a return to the restaurant as the
most democratic plan, for then each fellow would get
what he paid for. The hotel, or &ldquo;family style,&rdquo; serving
proved unsatisfactory, and six members were appointed
as a commission to investigate the comparative cost of
hotel meals and restaurant serving. Cantagrel presided
at the meeting. This commission found that the &ldquo;family
style&rdquo; was not paying expenses, so they decided to establish
a sort of cafeteria in which each was given the same
portion. However, this arrangement could not be instituted
until May 10, 1856, because Considerant would
not surrender his house for the purpose. During the first
three months of operation the new plan was very successful
and was able to improve the meals by serving
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
various foods such as chicken, beef, pork, and mutton.
But when Cantagrel left and was succeeded by Dethoya
the project disintegrated because the chief waiter or
cashier began to steal the money and serve poorer food.
When so much trouble arose, Dethoya had twenty people
to sign a proof of his honesty. Madame Considerant
also sided with him against Guillmet.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_21" href="#fn_6_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>The co-operative kitchen broke up into dozens of
small ones, one of which was able to have good food at
twenty-five sous per day. People withdrew into separate
institutions and planted small gardens. Slaves
brought them fish for which they paid twenty-five cents
for ten or fifteen pounds. Savardan&rsquo;s group lived there
for six months after the breakup of the general colony.</p>
<p>For a time the colonists were not interested in stocking
the land or planting crops. Most of them came fairly
well supplied with money and did not find it necessary
to work for their daily living until their reserve funds
began to dwindle. Then, according to one report, sheep,
cows, hogs, and chickens were purchased, even against
the advice of Considerant. The cattle numbered about
six hundred when the final survey of affairs was made.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_22" href="#fn_6_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>It is exceedingly difficult to reconstruct the system of
work carried on in La R&eacute;union. In one place it is said
that the laborer received one-third of the products of his
labor; in another statement it was said that each worker
was paid a stipulated sum and that near riots occurred
in an attempt to get higher wages. Toward the end of
the colony&rsquo;s existence the &ldquo;reserves&rdquo; were apportioned
to each man according to his deserts. Just how these
reserves were accumulated is not clear; however, they
appear to have consisted of money or goods stored up in
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
excess of the actual demands of the colony. In some
cases the reserve accumulated from contributions made
by incoming colonists and in other instances it was
formed from excess production.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_23" href="#fn_6_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was some order and plan even in
this chaos. There was to be a council of six men, in
addition to Considerant, which was to govern locally all
of La R&eacute;union. Then, there was the Council of Workmen,
supported by all workers, which elected two workers
to be added to the council of six. This Council of
Workmen was formed by organized groups of laborers
who elected one member from each trade group. For
example, Mr. Louckx was committeeman of the workers
in wood. Dailly was head of metal workers, and other
trades were similarly organized.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_24" href="#fn_6_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Men were assigned to certain work; quite often they
were changed day by day. This led to waste and inefficiency.
On one job six men were employed in marking cattle,
and because of their ignorance they often
burned the cattle severely, marking only about twenty-five
each day. However, in May, 1856, a young veterinarian,
M. Louis, took charge of this trade and marked
as many as seventy a day. Dr. Savardan tells how he,
a trained physician, and several professional men were
set to cutting wood. Considerant, noticing that they
were destroying the younger trees, called their attention
to it, whereupon two of the woodcutters became very
angry and contended with him. These same men also
built fences, dug wells, and did other odd jobs about the
place. In spite of the apparent universality of labor,
there was some complaint that all were not showing
returns from their labors, and contention arose as to
whether all should produce something of general value.</p>

<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VII
<br />THE BREAKUP</h2>
<p>La R&eacute;union was a failure from the moment it started;
it was never a success. Of course, a historian cannot
predict what would have happened under certain given
conditions, but it seems reasonable to believe that any
other type of colony formed by the same people under
the same conditions would also have been a failure.</p>
<p>In the first place, Considerant was not a suitable man
to head such an enterprise. His theory of colonization
as propounded in <i>Au Texas</i> is reasonable enough and, if
followed, could probably succeed under favorable conditions.
However, his weaknesses were his personal attitude
and his lack of administrative ability. Savardan
says that Considerant was a great organizer and promoter
but did not possess a sense of continuity or of
development. He easily became discouraged and soon
lost interest in proposed plans and procedures. When
he arrived in New York in 1854 on his return to Texas,
he was met by the denunciation of the Know-Nothing
Party (American Party.) Tirades against foreigners
made by leaders of the party were diplomatically and
ably answered by Considerant&rsquo;s pamphlet, <i>European
Colonization in America</i>, but in spite of his confident
tone exhibited in this pamphlet, he became discouraged
from that moment. His absolute faith in the sense of
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
justice of the American people, as stated in <i>Au Texas</i>,
vanished and he was forced to realize the absurd servility
of people who will subject themselves to demagogues in
time of national hysteria. Considerant never exhibited
any sign of vigor, initiative, or enthusiasm after the
publication of his address to the American people.</p>
<p>When he joined Savardan&rsquo;s party in Galveston, a
change in his attitude was evident. He was sullen, withdrawn,
and sensitive to criticism. Instead of going with
the party from Houston to Dallas, he went to Austin
and then to La R&eacute;union. However, there is no indication
in the records of any initiative on his part to put the
colony in shape, or of any plan of unity of development
worked out. The moment he reached La R&eacute;union he
began to think of leaving it. In a conversation between
Cantagrel and Savardan in April, 1856, before all the
colonists had arrived, Savardan understood that Considerant
had come to the conclusion to disband the
colony, to parcel out the land to colonists and others,
and to break up the community affairs. Savardan states
that not more than ten per cent of the colonists wanted
to divide up the land, that most of them felt that they
could not exist independently.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_1" href="#fn_7_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Considerant, leader of the whole undertaking, was
never in the colony for any length of time. He was
alternately at Austin, San Antonio, or Uvalde, and
consequently, when he was at La R&eacute;union, he could not
make any decision because he was unacquainted with the
workings of the organization. Apparently, refusal of the
state legislature to grant the lands which Considerant
had expected to obtain for the colonists completely destroyed
what hope he had left; it was after this refusal
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
that he wrote to France advising that no more colonists
be sent.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_2" href="#fn_7_2">[2]</a> Finally, after an absence of five months, he returned
to the colony from a trip into Southwest Texas,
and being convinced that the colony was doomed, appointed
a successor to himself and suddenly, on July
7, 1856, departed in secret.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_3" href="#fn_7_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Considerant, in his pamphlet <i>Du Texas</i>, assumes all
blame for the failure of the La R&eacute;union experiment and
confesses that he had a serious lack of confidence in himself.
After his plans failed, he became a despairing and
broken man, often planning to end all by self-destruction.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_4" href="#fn_7_4">[4]</a>
It is certainly true that this lack of self-confidence
prevented success of the colony.</p>
<p>The second reason for its failure was the mismanagement
of financial affairs. Considerant reported about
1857 that &ldquo;During two years, the greater part of the
disposable funds were wasted under my own eyes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7_5" href="#fn_7_5">[5]</a>
But Savardan gives a different story: he lists several
funds which he claims Considerant, himself, wasted.
His evidence is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. $3,000 wasted by an inefficient gardener who, Considerant
insisted, should be at the head of the agricultural
work.</p>
<p>b. That Considerant paid double price for meat when
it could have been raised on the farms of La R&eacute;union.
There were no sheep or pigs&mdash;$300.</p>
<p>c. That he bought carriages and horses for himself
which he did not need, at least they were better
than were required, for which he charged the society
under the head of personal expense&mdash;$300.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>d. That he built for himself and family a cottage
instead of living in the commodious buildings of the
colony with the remainder of the colonists and
charged the cost to personal expenses&mdash;$1,000.</p>
<p>e. The horses that were lost by theft or death unnecessarily
and the carriages and other equipment which
soon depreciated in value because of lack of sheds,
etc., the poorly constructed houses and other buildings,
which would soon have to be replaced&mdash;$10,000.</p>
<p>f. The failure of Considerant to pay his own passage
and transportation as other colonists had done&mdash;$100.</p>
<p>g. Numerous trips from San Antonio to Uvalde for the
purchase of land when one or two trips would have
been sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the above does not convict Considerant of serious
mismanagement, it does indicate a lack of system.
However, in another place he is charged with using
funds without giving any account to the directors, and
of entrusting the financial affairs of the colony to dishonest
men.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_6" href="#fn_7_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Even though the society owned all its tools, cattle, and
other property, there was apparently no method used to
check the use of this property until toward the close of
1856, nearly two years after the organization was
started. Bussy, who had charge of the equipment, became
disgusted and resigned; then Savardan took over
the work. He listed all equipment and tools on cards
and then numbered each object so he could keep up with
all the property belonging to the company. The records
of this checking were kept in a large book which he left
at La R&eacute;union on his departure therefrom. All the cattle,
hogs, and other livestock were also numbered, and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
proposal was made that even the colonists themselves
should be assigned a number by which their accounts
could be checked. All property loaned and assigned to
members of the colony had to be checked out and a
record of it kept by a young man appointed as caretaker.
This scheme apparently worked well and the serious loss
of materials which had occurred previously was checked.
However, a minor reform such as Savardan made could
not revitalize the faulty financial system.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_7" href="#fn_7_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>In addition to mismanagement there was downright
dishonesty and misapplication of funds. This was especially
true in the mismanagement of the restaurant and in
the keeping of accounts with individuals of the colony.
Savardan stated that Cousin took $98.00 from him
which he deposited with the treasurer of the colony for
safe-keeping. Others had the same experience. Apparently
some one applied to the courts in Dallas for redress,
for on July 16, 1857, the Dallas court made inquiry
as to the administration. Considerant refused even
to attempt a settlement of the accounts and the company
sent a Mr. Simonin to La R&eacute;union from New York to
audit the accounts. He spent three months in the colony
and investigated more than 200 accounts, arranged them
satisfactorily, and then turned the business over to
another man also sent from New York.</p>
<p>A third reason for the failure of La R&eacute;union was the
failure of the Americans to participate in its promotion
and settlement. Both Brisbane and Considerant had
planned to have as many Americans as Frenchmen in the
colony, but there were never more than twenty and
perhaps less than a dozen. One colonist tells about
Pendleton and Newton, two American carpenters, who
joined the colony. They knew nothing about Fourierism
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
and had merely heard about socialism. Their wives wore
bloomers, being followers of Mrs. Blummer who advocated
freedom of women&rsquo;s dress. Savardan said that he
had no objections to bloomers as they were an improvement
over the old &ldquo;hoop skirt&rdquo; which flew up every time
a woman sat down in a carriage. In addition to these
four Americans there were only a few others, all of
whom had left the colony by September, 1857.</p>
<p>Lack of interest on the part of the Americans might
be explained on the grounds of the intense American
nationalism of the time, the sad experiences of Peter&rsquo;s
Colony, and the &ldquo;law of reserve&rdquo; which had caused a
very sudden rise in the price of land in the vicinity of
La R&eacute;union. After Brisbane&rsquo;s visit and the first flush
of excitement and investment, very little attention was
paid by Americans to the experiment. The attitude of
the Texas newspapers and the total lack of interest, even
hostility, of the state legislature, certainly contributed
to the failure.</p>
<p>The climate might be cited as a fourth reason for the
breakup of the colony. The years 1855-1857 seem to
have been unusual years judging from reports of the
colonists themselves and of other Texas settlers living
in various parts of the state. Considerant reports that
the winter 1856-1857 was a very cold one, and was
considered by old settlers to have been the coldest in
their memory. Another colonist says that there were
twenty-three days of ice in January and from February
7 to March 2 the temperature measured an average of
fifteen degrees above zero inside the cabins. This statement
is supported by Bureau who arrived in La R&eacute;union
January 17, 1857, and found the temperature fifteen
degrees below zero. The cold brought great suffering
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
to the settlers, especially to women and children living
in the poorly built cabins.</p>
<p>When spring came there was no relief. Drought took
the place of cold. Springs dried up and the obtaining
of water became a serious problem. Crops came up only
to wither and die under the blast of dry winds. Cattle
had to be driven to the river for water, but there was no
water available for the gardens. The farmers found it
difficult to raise anything, especially since they refused
to follow instructions of the scientific farmers in the
colony. Thus, cold weather, drought, and discouragement
undermined the morale of the group and one by
one the settlers began to disperse.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after these things are taken into consideration,
and all due allowances are made for these
factors, there remains the pertinent fact that the colonists
could never agree. There were racial divisions, Belgians
vs. French, and conflicts arising between individual
members. The most severe disagreements were
between the leaders rather than in the rank and file.
Savardan, the most garrulous and troublesome of the
whole group, tells numerous stories about these misunderstandings.
He states that Considerant, Rogers,
and Raizant made every effort in their power to prevent
colonists from coming to La R&eacute;union. Barclay, a Swiss,
came to the colony in 1855 with twenty others, all
healthy and strong, intending to become permanent
settlers. However, because of the attitude of the colonists,
especially of Considerant, all except one soon left
and established themselves elsewhere. He also wrote
about the coming of Santerre and his family. Santerre
sold his farm in France and with seven children started
to America. They were dumped on the shore near a
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
Houston farm without anyone to guide them, finally
reaching the farm after much trouble. There Raizant
did everything he could to prevent them from continuing
their journey to La R&eacute;union, but without success. When
the family did arrive at La R&eacute;union, Cousin tried to
make them leave by the use of sarcasm.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_8" href="#fn_7_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Once when Savardan accused Cousin of forgery of
a document which placed him in control of the colony,
Cousin threatened to place Savardan in prison, whereupon
Savardan immediately withdrew into the house
and challenged Cousin to enter, at the same time reminding
him of the American law which gave a man
the right to protect his own home. After considerable
trouble the two men were quieted and the incident
passed without any serious results.</p>
<p>Several times, near riots occurred when the men of
the colony met to discuss various complaints, those
concerning wages especially. Sometimes these disturbances
would be ended by the appointment of a committee
to consider the matter, after which very little
was done&mdash;in fact, nothing could be done, as the company
had no resources with which to pay nor to make
good losses which had occurred. These continual bickerings
would have destroyed the colony had nothing else
entered the situation to hasten the end. Finally, no
socialistic experiment could have been a success under
frontier conditions in Texas. The doctrine of Utopian
Socialism is a system which deals with industrial conditions
and could hardly be applicable to the agrarian
frontier. In addition, the capitalistic system had greater
rewards to offer individual efforts than did the Utopian
social dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Thus, a fantastic plan of a French socialist colony
came to an end, wrecked upon the individualistic tendencies
and weaknesses of its membership. Texas has
been made richer culturally by the attempts of these
dreamers to better conditions and transform the society
in which they lived, even though no economic gain came
to these individuals.</p>

<h2 id="c9">APPENDIX</h2>
<h3 id="c10">A. Partial List of Settlers</h3>
<p>This list has been compiled from all the bibliographical
data used in this research, including the census report
of 1850 and 1860. There are doubtless duplications
since no effort has been made to check transfer of a son
or daughter from a family list to a new family by marriage,
etc. American reporters of that time and writers
of a later date were not accurate in spelling French
names. A careful check of names has been made on
tombstones in the Old French Cemetery. Many times
names were found such as &ldquo;Dumirel&rdquo; with no first name
and no further appearance. In this case the name was
listed just as it appeared. This list is not complete but
it contains more names than any other list known at this
time. The symbol (S) has been used where the spelling
or listing is different but evidently of the same family.
The most helpful list and the most complete is by Eloise
Santerre contained in her thesis, <i>R&eacute;union ... with a
Biographical Dictionary of the Settlers</i>. She also identifies
each settler wherever possible.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER CCCX</h4>
<p class="center">An Act to Incorporate the European and American Colonization Society in Texas</p>
<p>Whereas, A company under the name of the European
and American Colonization Society in Texas has
been formed in Brussels between Victor Prosper Considerant,
Allyre Bureau, Charles Francois Guillon, Jean
Baptiste Andre, Goden Lemaire and their associates, on
the 26th day of September, A.D. 1854, as appeared by
an act deposited at the office of Mr. Hedweld, Notary
in said city, and duly legalized and certified on the 20th
day of January, AD. 1855, by the Consul of the United
States at Antwerp, the nature and object of which said
company consists in the Union of intended colonists
creating a joint stock, and constituting an agency to
enable its shareholders to emigrate to Texas to colonize,
to improve lands, to transfer hither their manufactories,
to introduce new culture and new branches of industry.
And whereas, the objects of said association are calculated
to develop the resources and add to the population
and wealth of this State. Therefore, Be it enacted by
the Legislature of the State of Texas,</p>
<p>Section 1. That Victor Prosper Considerant, Allyre
Bureau, Charles Francois Guillion, Jean Baptiste Andre,
Godin Lemaire and their associates, successors be, and
they are hereby constituted a body politic and corporate,
by the name of the European and American Colonization
Society in Texas, with power and authority in said
corporate name to have succession, to make contracts, to
have and use a seal, to acquire by purchase, donation or
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
otherwise, and to own, manage and alienate property
real, mixed and personal, to sue and be sued, to plead
and be impleaded in law and equity in like manner and
as fully as natural persons, to carry on, conduct and
manage any kind of manufacturing, mechanical or agricultural
business, to issue shares and negotiate them, to
borrow money by mortgage on its property or otherwise;
to have a President, Directors, Secretaries and Treasurers,
and all such officers and agents as the company
may deem necessary, and to prescribe their powers and
duties; to make such by-laws, rules and regulations, not
inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of this State
or of the United States, as they may deem necessary and
proper for the government of said company and the
management of its affairs and interests, and to possess
generally all the powers, rights, immunities and privileges
necessary to carry into effect the provisions and objects
of the said association.</p>
<p>Provided, that a majority of the Directors of said
Company and the President thereof shall be residents
of Texas, and that the principal office shall be kept in
this State, where all writs and citations shall be served.
And further provided, that this act shall not be so construed
as to entitle said company to the benefits of any
law granting lands or money to any railroad, manufacturing
or colonization company, nor shall it authorize
said company to prohibit slavery in any Territory occupied
by it.</p>
<p>Section 2. The capital stock issued by the said Company
shall not exceed one million dollars, to be divided
into shares of such values and entitling the share holders
thereof to vote in such manner as shall be prescribed by
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
the by-laws of said company; the duration of which shall
not exceed twenty years from the passage of this act.</p>
<p>Section 3. That the shareholders or corporators of
the company, by this act incorporated, shall be liable for
all debts and obligations of said company in the same
manner and to the same extent as general partners are
by law now liable.</p>
<p>Passed, September 1st, 1856.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Special Laws of the Sixth Legislature of the State of Texas
passed at its adjourned session convened July 7, 1856 (Austin
1856) 216-217, in H.P.N. Gammel, <i>The Laws of Texas</i>, 1822-1897,
Vol. IV (Austin, 1898), pp. 762-763.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the
State of Texas, That the third section of the above
entitled act be so amended that the same shall hereafter
read as follows: That the Shareholders or Corporators
of the Company shall be liable for all debts and obligations
of said Company, to the extent of the Capital Stock

appears that Bell used an indefensibly wide interpretation of
Marxianism to demand so many pages to relate the actions of
the followers of Marx. An example, from the viewpoint of this
author, may be noted on page 250. The discussion in these two
hundred and fifty pages is a splendid story of American Socialism
but hardly of Marxian Socialism in America.</div>

<p>LA REUNION, A French Settlement in Texas, by
W. J. and Margaret F. Hammond, is the story
of one of the great romantic attempts to settle
Texas. It is also the failure of several
hundred Europeans to realize their dreams.</p>
<p>This venture was led by Victor Prosper Considerant
who headed a group of several hundred
colonists that came to the Dallas-Fort
Worth area in 1855 to establish La Reunion a
few miles west of Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>Considerant intended this colony to be an experiment.
However, those who joined him thought
in terms of actual accomplishments. Most
of the colonists were college graduates. Many
of them were professional people who were
successful in European countries. They knew
nothing of Texas Frontier life and were not
prepared for the heavy demands the climate
would make upon their existence. Even though
these factors contributed to the disintegration
of the colony and experiment, the chief
reason for failure was the contrast of this
socialistic dream with an unlimited capitalism.</p>
<p>While La Reunion is a product of historical
research, the authors have related the story
in an interesting, brisk style. The gathering
of all footnotes on specific pages instead of
placing them at the bottom of each page will
be found to be more convenient in research.</p>

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
